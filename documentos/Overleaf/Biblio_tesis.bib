	abstract = {The concept of User Experience (UX) dates back to the 1990s, but a shared definition of UX is not available. As design integrates UX, different interpretations thereof can complicate the possibility to build upon previous literature and develop the field autonomously. Indeed, by analysing the literature, UX emerges as a cauldron of related and closely linked concepts. However, it is possible to find recurring attributes that emerge from those definitions, which are ascribable to two foci: the fundamental elements of the interaction (user, system, context) and typologies of experience (ergonomic, cognitive, and emotional). Those are used to build a framework. We have preliminarily investigated how UX is dealt with in design by mapping a sample of UX-related experimental articles published in design journals. We classified UX case studies based on the framework to individuate the UXs that emerge most frequently and the most studied ones in the design field. The two-focus framework allows the mapping of experiments involving UX in design, without highlighting specific favorable combinations. However, comprehensive studies dealing with all elements and UX typologies have not been found.},

UI/UX is designed to be a "bridge" between the users and the system to finish their tasks or goals. This article explores the importance of evaluating the UI/UX design of a web application or software to usability. The literature was reviewed to determine the contributing aspects of success in building a good UI/UX according to the users' needs. The review examined up to 455 articles published between 1990 – 2020 on outstanding indexing databases that were aggregated under ‘Heuristic Evaluation’, ‘UI/UX Design’, and ‘UI/UX Usability’ keywords. The papers were filtered exhaustively against the Systematic Literature Review framework resulting twenty prominent articles. The review indicates three competing factors influence usability namely design principles, user involvement, and evaluator's perceptions. Besides, it is also known that the Heuristic Evaluation method is quite influential in building a good UI/UX. By considering the significant factors that can improve the quality of the UI/UX and usability, the existing heuristic problems that related to the users’ needs in UI/UX design will be appropriately resolved.},

For Mixed Reality Environments such as Augmented and Virtual Reality, the user interface is highly visual, and a poor interface can significantly degrade the user experience. Adequate attention is required when designing or creating interfaces and user experience within Mixed Reality Environments as traditional interface design goals and specifications often need to be adjusted. Furthermore, for mixed reality environments on Mobile devices there are additional interface constraints and considerations that would considerably improve the user experience when properly addressed. This research paper discusses the evolution(s) of user interface(s) and user experience of Augmented and Virtual Reality applications on Mobile devices and contributes a framework for improving user interfaces and experience when using Mixed Reality Environments.},

However, many UI principles have been proposed, scattered in scientific papers and teaching books. Some principles are different, and many are somehow similar or overlapping with others. This makes it very difficult to comprehend where to pay attention to when designing a UI. In this paper, we perform a systematic literature review to first identify the most relevant authors in the domain of functional UI design principles. Focusing on the three most cited works of these authors, we extracted 257 principles. We next analyzed all these principles, unified their variants, and, considering their scientific influence, finally derived a shorter and core selection of 36 principles. This core selection provides educators and UI designers with a clear path to teach, evaluate, learn and improve the UI functional design.},

The research approach is documentary that helped the review of the state of the art, quali-quantitative in the stage of compliance analysis according to parameters of interaction, usability and functionality. The methodology created by Rodrigo Ronda León was used, which consists of four stages: research, organization, design and testing; which allowed the design of the analysis sheets applied to the home page, commercial line and shopping cart of the e-commerce site www.eljuri.store in the parameters of evaluation, usability and functionality, the heuristic evaluation sheets, of compliance with the UX / UI methodology, in turn the comparison was made with the design team of the Warehouse who designed the website. The aspects that were analyzed to demonstrate that there is a relationship between following a methodological process for the creation of a website containing UX/UI design elements and its impact reflected in the levels of functionality were: the comparison between the methodology used by the design team of Almacenes Juan Eljuri when creating the website and the methodology according to Rodrigo Ronda León, adding the heuristic principles of Jakob Nielsen to analyze both the website and the user, the same that allowed the evidence of 70\% compliance with the parameters of analysis. Finally, it is concluded that the elements that constitute the UX/UI design work as a solid structure for the generation of engagement or user attraction, thus positioning the website in search engines as an SEO outreach strategy and the need for a methodology based on these principles.},

In addition, the moderating role of technology anxiety in the relationships between chatbot quality dimensions and post-use confirmation is examined. Survey data were gathered from 295 users of Chinese OTAs. Partial Least Square (PLS) was used to analyze measurement and structural models. Understandability, reliability, assurance, and interactivity are positively associated with post-use confirmation and technology anxiety moderates the relationships between four chatbot quality dimensions and confirmation. Confirmation is positively associated with satisfaction, which in turn influences use continuance intention. This study examines how chatbot services in OTAs are considered by users (human-like agents vs. technology-enabled services) by investigating the moderating role of technology anxiety.},

Efforts to make moral psychology a thoroughly empirical discipline have divided philosophers along methodological fault lines, isolating discussions that will profit more from intellectual exchange. This volume takes an even-handed approach, including essays from advocates of empirical ethics as well as those who are sceptical of some of its central claims. Some of these essays make novel use of empirical findings to develop philosophical research programs regarding such crucial moral phenomena as desire, emotion, and memory. Others bring new critical scrutiny to bear on some of the most influential proposals of the empirical ethics movement, including the claim that evolution undermines moral realism, the effort to recruit a dual-process model of the mind to support consequentialism against other moral theories, and the claim that ordinary evaluative judgments are seldom if ever sensitive to reasons, because moral reasoning is merely the post hoc rationalization of unthinking emotional response},

	abstract = {What happens in our brains to make us feel fear, love, hate, anger, joy? do we control our emotions, or do they control us? Do animals have emotions? How can traumatic experiences in early childhood influence adult behavior, even though we have no conscious memory of them? In The Emotional Brain, Joseph LeDoux investigates the origins of human emotions and explains that many exist as part of complex neural systems that evolved to enable us to survive. Unlike conscious feelings, emotions originate in the brain at a much deeper level, says LeDoux, a leading authority in the field of neural science and one of the principal researchers profiled in Daniel Goleman's Emotional Intelligence. In this provocative book, LeDoux explores the underlying brain mechanisms responsible for our emotions, mechanisms that are only now being revealed. The Emotional Brain presents some fascinating findings about our familiar yet little understood emotions. For example, our brains can detect danger before we even experience the feeling of being afraid. The brain also begins to initiate physical responses (heart palpitations, sweaty palms, muscle tension) before we become aware of an associated feeling of fear. Conscious feelings, says LeDoux, are somewhat irrelevant to the way the emotional brain works. He points out that emotional responses are hard-wired into the brain's circuitry, but the things that make us emotional are learned through experience. And this may be the key to understanding, even changing, our emotional makeup. Many common psychiatric problems - such as phobias or posttraumatic stress disorder - involve malfunctions in the way emotion systems learn and remember. Understanding how these mechanisms normally work will have important consequences for how we view ourselves and how we treat emotional disorders.},

There are, on the one hand, those theories that owe their ancestry to the work of William James, arguing that emotions are bodily feelings or perceptions of bodily feelings; and, on the other hand, those theories that owe their ancestry to Aristotle and the Stoics, arguing that emotions are cognitive, world-directed intentional states. Other philosophers have argued that, whilst there are analogies to be drawn between emotion and other kinds of mental state, emotions are, at bottom, sui generis.},

	abstract = {This essay, published in Mind, IX (1884), 188-204, constitutes James' first publication on the James-Lange theory of the emotions. The physiologists who, during the past few years, have been so industriously exploring the functions of the brain, have limited their attempts at explanation to its cognitive and volitional performances. Dividing the brain into sensorial and motor centres, they have found their division to be exactly paralleled by the analysis made by empirical psychology, of the perceptive and volitional parts of the mind into their simplest elements. But the aesthetic sphere of the mind, its longings, its pleasures and pains, and its emotions, have been ignored in all these researches. And yet it is even now certain that of two things concerning the emotions, one must be true. Either separate and special centres, affected to them alone, are their brain-seat, or else they correspond to processes occurring in the motor and sensory centres, already assigned, or in others like them, not yet mapped out. If the former be the case we must deny the current view, and hold the cortex to be something more than the surface of projection for every sensitive spot and every muscle in the body. If the latter be the case, we must ask whether the emotional process in the sensory or motor centre be an altogether peculiar one, or whether it resembles the ordinary perceptive processes of which those centres are already recognised to be the seat. The purpose of the following pages is to show that the last alternative comes nearest to the truth, and that the emotional brain-processes not only resemble the ordinary sensorial brain-processes, but in very truth, are nothing but such processes variously combined.

Mapping the trajectories of technological development and impact that the newer media exert on human condition, our analysis touches upon various forms of emergent affect, emotion, and feeling in order to trace the histories and motivations of the sensitization of “the media things” as well as the redefinition of our affective and emotional experiences through technologies that themselves “feel.”},

The contributors to this special issue address the importance of understanding and measuring emotions in TREs as a mechanism for fostering learning. In particular, the special issue situates this research with a systemic review and meta-analysis of the literature on emotions in TREs. Following this review empirical research is presented on measuring emotions in the context of learning with TREs in multiple domains, including medicine, history, and mathematics. These researchers use concurrent measures to capture students’ cognitive, metacognitive and aﬀective processes before, during, and after solving problems, documenting the complex role of such processes as individuals and groups learn with technology. The special issue concludes with two commentaries that point the way to next steps in this ﬁeld of research.},

People’s attitudes towards emotion recognition and the harms and outcomes they associate with it are important yet unknown. Focusing on social media, we interviewed 13 adult U.S. social media users to fill this gap. We find that people view emotions as insights to behavior, prone to manipulation, intimate, vulnerable, and complex. Many find emotion recognition invasive and scary, associating it with autonomy and control loss. We identify two categories of emotion recognition’s risks: individual and societal. We discuss findings’ implications for algorithmic accountability and argue for considering emotion data as sensitive. Using a Science and Technology Studies lens, we advocate that technology users should be considered as a relevant social group in emotion recognition advancements.},

Some adopt an externalist framework, arguing that the Internet should be seen as environmental scaffolding that drives and shapes cognition. However, despite growing interest in this topic, little attention has been paid to how the Internet influences our affective life—our moods, our emotions, and our ability to regulate these and other feeling states. We argue that the Internet scaffolds not only cognition but also affect. Using various case studies, we consider some ways that we are increasingly dependent on our Internet-enabled “techno-social niches” to regulate the contours of our own affective life and participate in the affective lives of others. We argue further that, unlike many of the other environmental resources we use to regulate affect, the Internet has distinct properties that introduce new dimensions of complexity to these regulative processes. First, it is radically social in a way many of these other resources are not. Second, it is a radically distributed and decentralized resource; no one individual or agent is responsible for the Internet’s content or its affective impact on users. Accordingly, while the Internet can profoundly augment and enrich our affective life and deepen our connection with others, there is also a distinctive kind of affective precarity built into our online endeavors as well.},

Three issues are given particular attention: firstly the reasons for learners' use or lack of use of technologies for their learning; secondly adult learners' attitudes towards using technology for learning and thirdly how technology might support socio-emotional development and expression in children. The discussion of these issues is framed by two of the author's research projects. For the first two issues this is an early study of students' perceptions and attitudes towards using computers for tutorial learning in 1980. The factors that influenced the students' use of the computer tutorials are discussed (including access, assessment and anxiety about using computers) and also the extent to which some of these factors persist for many learners using (or not using) technologies today. The discussion of the third issue draws on a series of studies conducted in the 1990s to investigate whether educational technology could support children and young people's emotional expression and communication and development of socio-emotional skills. Finally the paper considers how these kinds of issues have been taken forward and how they are represented in contemporary research and suggests that trust is an important factor in using learning technologies.},

HCI has long recognized the importance of the emotional response to technology: this is fundamental to the concept of user experience. But people sometimes use digital technology to manipulate mood: a phenomenon which is less explored by HCI. This paper argues that mood-enhancement is a significant motive for innovation and adoption, and proposes that HCI look to other disciplines for insight into why users manipulate mood and with what consequences. Anthropological research into drug use, for example, has found that mood enhancement is an important component of social and organizational life. The paper concludes that contemporary technology is making this social function more ubiquitously available. The paper’s contribution is theoretical: proposing a new lens for understanding some human-computer interactions.},

	abstract = {The study of individual, affect-related consequences from technology adoption and use is gaining traction in the information systems discipline. Efforts to explore affective reactions to technology have considered positive, affective constructs (e.g., enjoyment, playfulness, and flow), with a more recent focus on the dark side of technology use and constructs such as technostress, technophobia, and computer anxiety. While some research has examined these negative affective responses to technology, construct definitions and relationships are not welldefined or theoretically grounded. In this research, an integrative literature review is conducted on computer anxiety, technophobia and technostress, and the known antecedents, dimensions, and outcomes of each concept are organised into nomological networks. These nomological networks are then combined to identify inconsistencies and omissions in the literature. The Affective Response Model, a recently advanced, theoretically grounded taxonomy of affective responses to technology, is applied to differentiate the three constructs and to introduce technology-induced state anxiety (TISA), a new temporal (state-like) negative response to a specific instance of technology. Two empirical studies are conducted using existing and newly developed scales, and demonstrate that computer anxiety, technophobia, technostress and TISA are conceptually and empirically distinct and provide insight into how these constructs are related. Future research opportunities on affective responses to technology are described based on the integrated nomological network and empirical findings.},

Specifically, we examined the mediating role of cognitive appraisals of control and value in the relationship between students’ digital technology use and emotions. Data were collected through online questionnaires from a sample of 1476 first- and second-grade high school students from 50 schools. The results of path analyses revealed that digital technology use (i.e. students’ ICT-based activities related to learning) was positively associated with enjoyment and pride, both directly and indirectly through the perceived competence (control appraisal) and interest (value appraisal) in science and mathematics subjects. Findings further indicated that digital technology use was not directly negatively related to emotions of anxiety and boredom, but rather indirectly through students’ cognitive appraisals. The perceived competence as control appraisal mediated the relation between digital technology use and both anxiety and boredom, while the perceived interest and importance as value appraisals mediated the effect of digital technology use on boredom only. The results can help educational practitioners to shape technology-based learning environments in affectively beneficial ways by utilizing learning technologies that enhance students’ sense of competence and promote interest and value in mathematics and science subjects.},

The number of academic articles published that mention “sentiment analysis” grew from 78 in 2008 to 1,876 in 2018 (Web of Science). This growth brought notable advances in sentiment classification whether it be measuring emotional valence (i.e., negative vs. positive sentiment) or the measurement of discrete, specific emotions (e.g., “anger”). In particular, there has been recent interest in measuring emotion expressions in social media text, as there are now over 3 billion users expressing emotions online on a regular basis. Although there is now a wealth of emotion expression data that exists on social media, only recently have psychological scientists begun to make use of it for the purposes of observational research and psychological hypothesis testing. In this chapter, we aim to provide psychologists with a practical guide for making use of advances in sentiment analysis for the purpose of measuring specific emotions in social media text, and ultimately testing hypotheses. We begin with an examination of the type of emotion-related information researchers can expect to measure in social media text. Next, we present a practical guide for the theory-driven application of supervised machine learning to measure specific emotion expressions on social media using the measurement of moral outrage expression as a case study. We end with considerations for researchers who wish to apply sentiment analysis of social media text for the purposes of psychological hypothesis testing.},

	abstract = {Multimodal emotion recognition has gained much traction in the ﬁeld of affective computing, human–computer interaction (HCI), artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), and user experience (UX). There is growing demand to automate analysis of user emotion towards HCI, AI, and UX evaluation applications for providing affective services. Emotions are increasingly being used, obtained through the videos, audio, text or physiological signals. This has led to process emotions from multiple modalities, usually combined through ensemble-based systems with static weights. Due to numerous limitations like missing modality data, inter-class variations, and intra-class similarities, an effective weighting scheme is thus required to improve the aforementioned discrimination between modalities. This article takes into account the importance of difference between multiple modalities and assigns dynamic weights to them by adapting a more efﬁcient combination process with the application of generalized mixture (GM) functions. Therefore, we present a hybrid multimodal emotion recognition (H-MMER) framework using multi-view learning approach for unimodal emotion recognition and introducing multimodal feature fusion level, and decision level fusion using GM functions. In an experimental study, we evaluated the ability of our proposed framework to model a set of four different emotional states (Happiness, Neutral, Sadness, and Anger) and found that most of them can be modeled well with signiﬁcantly high accuracy using GM functions. The experiment shows that the proposed framework can model emotional states with an average accuracy of 98.19\% and indicates signiﬁcant gain in terms of performance in contrast to traditional approaches. The overall evaluation results indicate that we can identify emotional states with high accuracy and increase the robustness of an emotion classiﬁcation system required for UX measurement.},

Although a number of techniques for measuring affect have been developed, a systematic discussion of their effectiveness and applicability in different contexts remains lacking, especially in social contexts with multiple users. As computing shifts to increasingly collaborative and ubiquitous models, it is important to discuss affect measurement beyond the individual level. This workshop will provide a forum where designers, practitioners, and researchers can 1) introduce novel methods of affect measurement that go beyond physiological and self-report measures, 2) advance our understanding of existing measurement methods and how they can be expanded, and 3) critically evaluate issues of affect measurement.},

	abstract = {How we design and evaluate for emotions depends crucially on what we take emotions to be. In affective computing, affect is often taken to be another kind of information—discrete units or states internal to an individual that can be transmitted in a loss-free manner from people to computational systems and back. While affective computing explicitly challenges the primacy of rationality in cognitivist accounts of human activity, at a deeper level it often relies on and reproduces the same information-processing model of cognition. Drawing on cultural, social, and interactional critiques of cognition which have arisen in human–computer interaction (HCI), as well as anthropological and historical accounts of emotion, we explore an alternative perspective on emotion as interaction: dynamic, culturally mediated, and socially constructed and experienced. We demonstrate how this model leads to new goals for affective systems—instead of sensing and transmitting emotion, systems should support human users in understanding, interpreting, and experiencing emotion in its full complexity and ambiguity. In developing from emotion as objective, externally measurable unit to emotion as experience, evaluation, too, alters focus from externally tracking the circulation of emotional information to co-interpreting emotions as they are made in interaction.},

	abstract = {Significance
            The President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology has called for a 33\% increase in the number of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) bachelor’s degrees completed per year and recommended adoption of empirically validated teaching practices as critical to achieving that goal. The studies analyzed here document that active learning leads to increases in examination performance that would raise average grades by a half a letter, and that failure rates under traditional lecturing increase by 55\% over the rates observed under active learning. The analysis supports theory claiming that calls to increase the number of students receiving STEM degrees could be answered, at least in part, by abandoning traditional lecturing in favor of active learning.
          , 
            
              To test the hypothesis that lecturing maximizes learning and course performance, we metaanalyzed 225 studies that reported data on examination scores or failure rates when comparing student performance in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses under traditional lecturing versus active learning. The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 SDs under active learning (
              n
              = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (
              n
              = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6\% in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the STEM disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes—although the greatest effects are in small (
              n
              ≤ 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe
              n
              calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate STEM education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms.},

Learners participate in communities of practitioners, moving toward full participation in the sociocultural practices of a community. Legitimate peripheral participation provides a way to speak about crucial relations between newcomers and oldtimers and about their activities, identities, artifacts, knowledge and practice. The communities discussed in the book are midwives, tailors, quartermasters, butchers, and recovering alcoholics, however, the process by which participants in those communities learn can be generalized to other social groups.},

	abstract = {Emotions ubiquitously impact action, learning, and perception, yet their essence and role remain widely debated. Computational accounts of emotion aspire to answer these questions with greater conceptual precision informed by normative principles and neurobiological data. We examine recent progress in this regard and find that emotions may implement three classes of computations, which serve to evaluate states, actions, and uncertain prospects. For each of these, we use the formalism of reinforcement learning to offer a new formulation that better accounts for existing evidence. We then consider how these distinct computations may map onto distinct emotions and moods. Integrating extensive research on the causes and consequences of different emotions suggests a parsimonious one-to-one mapping, according to which emotions are integral to how we evaluate outcomes (pleasure \& pain), learn to predict them (happiness \& sadness), use them to inform our (frustration \& content) and others’ (anger \& gratitude) actions, and plan in order to realize (desire \& hope) or avoid (fear \& anxiety) uncertain outcomes.},

The emotional domain may be treated as a speciﬁc kind of cognitive process, which implies that a dual mind systems approach could be very useful in understanding some types of emotion-cognition relations. Recently, a duality of mind approach has been applied to distinguish between so called automatic and reﬂective emotions. This provides for four types of emotion-cognition interactions. The experiential system governs the inﬂuence of automatic emotion processes on heuristic cognition and the rational system governs the inﬂuence of reﬂective emotion on systematic cognition, but the inﬂuences of automatic emotion on systematic cognition and reﬂective emotion on heuristic cognition involve cross-system interactions. Activation mechanisms are system-speciﬁc: arousal for the experiential and subjective signiﬁcance for the rational system.},

Second, we offer a working definition of emotion which also serves to summarize the main tenets of the theoretical point of view. Third, we draw upon this point of view to deal with a number of phylogenetic issues concerning the nature of emotion in humans and infra-humans. Finally, we attempt to redress the traditional imbalance of thought in which positively toned emotions have been neglected in favor of the negative. We systematically examine some of the conceptual issues that have made it difficult to integrate positively toned emotions into emotion theory. In this discussion, emphasis is placed on the functions of physiological changes in positively toned emotions and on the ways that positively toned emotions affect coping. Throughout, our view has been that the neglect of positively toned emotions in emotion theory has obscured their importance in human adaptation and in psychological growth and change.},

	abstract = {Emotion has a substantial inﬂuence on the cognitive processes in humans, including perception, attention, learning, memory, reasoning, and problem solving. Emotion has a particularly strong inﬂuence on attention, especially modulating the selectivity of attention as well as motivating action and behavior. This attentional and executive control is intimately linked to learning processes, as intrinsically limited attentional capacities are better focused on relevant information. Emotion also facilitates encoding and helps retrieval of information efﬁciently. However, the effects of emotion on learning and memory are not always univalent, as studies have reported that emotion either enhances or impairs learning and long-term memory (LTM) retention, depending on a range of factors. Recent neuroimaging ﬁndings have indicated that the amygdala and prefrontal cortex cooperate with the medial temporal lobe in an integrated manner that affords (i) the amygdala modulating memory consolidation; (ii) the prefrontal cortex mediating memory encoding and formation; and (iii) the hippocampus for successful learning and LTM retention. We also review the nested hierarchies of circular emotional control and cognitive regulation (bottom-up and top-down inﬂuences) within the brain to achieve optimal integration of emotional and cognitive processing. This review highlights a basic evolutionary approach to emotion to understand the effects of emotion on learning and memory and the functional roles played by various brain regions and their mutual interactions in relation to emotional processing. We also summarize the current state of knowledge on the impact of emotion on memory and map implications for educational settings. In addition to elucidating the memory-enhancing effects of emotion, neuroimaging ﬁndings extend our understanding of emotional inﬂuences on learning and memory processes; this knowledge may be useful for the design of effective educational curricula to provide a conducive learning environment for both traditional “live” learning in classrooms and “virtual” learning through online-based educational technologies.},

The objective of the present study was thus to analyze the efﬁciency of implicit learning among 8- to 11-year-old children and the impact of emotions on this type of learning. In order to analyze implicit learning, 65 elementary-school children performed a serial reaction time task in a laboratory context. Emotions were induced by asking the children to read six short emotional sentences and listen to classical music. Results showed a signiﬁcant impact of the task condition (semi-random or ﬁxed sequence) on reaction times. Moreover, the induction of happiness resulted in slightly longer reaction times compared with neutral induction. These results need to be deepened to better understand the interactions between emotions and implicit learning in children.},

Thirty-six academic staff and students from an Australian university were interviewed about emotional responses to a range of learning events. Data analysis was informed by a prototype approach to emotion research. Four categories of discrete negative emotions (anger, sadness, fear, boredom) were considered by teachers and students to be especially salient in learning, with self-conscious emotions (guilt, embarrassment, shame) mentioned by more students than staff. While negative emotions were frequently viewed as detrimental to motivation, performance and learning, they were also construed under some circumstances as beneﬁcial. The ﬁndings are discussed in relation to the value of social functional approaches for a better understanding of the diverse roles of negative emotions in learning and achievement.},

This study further examines the mediating role of student trust in teachers (emotional and cognitive learning) and learning orientation (commitment to learning) in the relationship between EI and learning outcomes. This intent of this study was to examine the direct effects of learning outcomes on students’ academic efficacy (cognitive skills and standardised tests). This study used a sample frame of 454 students from research universities in China. The relationships were tested through the partial least squares’ structural equation modelling method. The results reveal that EI has a significant impact on learning outcomes. Furthermore, an indirect relation between EI and learning outcomes is established through student trust in teachers and in the learning orientation. The direct relation between learning outcomes and student academic efficacy is also established. There is a lack of studies that investigate the relationship of EI, student trust in teachers, learning orientation, learning outcomes and student academic efficacy. This is one of the initial research studies that not only empirically examine the interface of EI and learning outcomes of students of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) but offers insights into the existing literature by concurrent investigation of the mediating role of student trust in teachers and in the learning orientation in fundamental association, while explaining the association between learning outcomes and students’ better academic efficacy.},

In this paper, we objectively evaluate the inﬂuence of various academic emotions on learning effects and studied the relationship between positive and negative academic emotions and learning effects by using ﬁve electronic databases, including WOS, EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar. According to established standards, a total of 14 articles from 506 articles were included in the analysis. We divided the 14 studies into nine intervention studies and ﬁve observational studies; ﬁve of the nine intervention studies found that students who used active learning materials performed better and had higher mental loads than those who used neutral learning materials. Positive academic emotions promoted the learning effect. Four of the ﬁve observational studies with high school, college, and postgraduate participants reported that regulating academic emotions can improve learning effects. In conclusion, this paper holds that positive academic emotions are better than negative academic emotions at improving academic performance. In future research, a new method combining multichannel video observation, physiological data, and facial expression data is proposed to capture learners’ learning behavior in various learning environments.},

	abstract = {Emotional information pervades experiences in daily life. Numerous studies have established that emotional materials and information are easier to remember than neutral ones, a phenomenon known as the emotional salience effect on memory. In recent years, an emerging body of research has begun to explore the effect of emotion on metamemory. Preliminary findings show that participants offer higher judgments of learning (JOLs) to emotional than to neutral stimuli, a phenomenon termed the emotional salience effect on JOLs. The present meta-analysis integrated data from 1,887 participants, extracted from 17 qualifying studies, to examine the effects of emotion on JOLs and memory and to explore potential moderators of these effects. The results showed a medium-sized (g = 0.53 [0.41, 0.64]) emotional salience effect on JOLs, which was moderated by age and material type, as well as a small to medium (g = 0.38 [0.25, 0.51) emotional salience effect on memory, which was moderated by test format. These findings establish that emotionality is a salient cue in the theoretical framework of metamemory, and also provide some practical implications (e.g., in eyewitness testimony). However, more research is needed, especially employing high-powered pre-registered experiments, to address the signals of publication bias detected in this meta-analysis.},

	abstract = {The research shows that a very important part of initial teacher education is to reformulate the beliefs that student teachers bring with them from their school experience. These beliefs, which are intuitive in nature, deal with different educational topics and one area that is currently of great importance, due to the emotional turn that the educational system is experiencing, are the beliefs that student teachers hold about the role of emotions in educational processes. In a world full of views that portray emotions as discrete states that are separate from cognitive processes, it is a priority for initial teacher development to train future teachers to hold conceptions that consider the deep emotional-cognitive integration that exists in the human brain. At the same time, this process requires teacher educators (hereafter referred to as TEs) who hold conceptions on this topic that are aligned with the most current scientific knowledge on the subject. However, we do not know how the conceptions that TEs maintain on this topic are, since, until now, research on conceptions has focused on other types of educational topics. Considering the foregoing, this study aimed to evaluate the conceptions that TEs have on this topic, using a questionnaire of dilemmas that was applied to 68 TEs from different universities. The results obtained show that the TEs maintain perspectives on the role of emotions in the teaching and learning processes that oscillate between dualism and emotional-cognitive integration. In addition, it was found that TEs’ perspectives tend to be more integrative when considering attitudinal learning than when considering verbal learning. Finally, the study shows that maintaining integrative perspectives is more difficult when educational situations involve emotions of positive valence that may constitute an obstacle for teaching and learning. The results are discussed, and a series of reflections are elaborated in order to analyze to what extent the beliefs held by TEs are adequate as a cognitive basis for reformulating the conceptions held by student teachers on this issue.},

In this paper, we document underlying forces that constitute a third wave in HCI and suggest systemic consequences for the CHI community. We provisionally name this the ‘phenomenological matrix’. In the course of creating technologies such as ubiquitous computing, visualization, affective and educational technology, a variety of approaches are addressing issues that are bad fits to prior paradigms, ranging from embodiment to situated meaning to values and social issues. We demonstrate the underlying unity of these approaches, and document how they suggest the centrality of currently marginal criteria for design, evaluation, appreciation, and developmental methodology in CHI work.},

Physical determinants encompassed muscle strength, functional mobility, and cardiorespiratory fitness, while psychological consisted of quality of life and activities of daily living. Multiple linear regression was performed to investigate this relationship. Physical and psychological determinants were significantly linked to cognitive impairment, including lower muscle strength, reduced functional mobility and of cardiorespiratory fitness. The influence of environment, autonomy, and engagement in daily activities on cognitive impairment was also observed.

              Objectives:
              A substantial body of research has documented age-related declines in cognitive abilities among adults over 60, yet there is much less known about changes in cognitive abilities during midlife. The goal was to examine longitudinal changes in multiple cognitive domains from early midlife through old age in a large national sample, the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study.
              Methods:
              The Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone (BTACT) was administered on two occasions (MIDUS 2, MIDUS 3), an average of 9 years apart. At MIDUS 3, those with the cognitive assessment (
              N
              =2518) ranged in age from 42 to 92 years (
              M
              =64.30;
              SD
              =11.20) and had a mean education of 14.68 years (
              SD
              =2.63). The BTACT includes assessment of key aging-sensitive cognitive domains: immediate and delayed free recall, number series, category fluency, backward digit span, processing speed, and reaction time for attention switching and inhibitory control, which comprise two factors: episodic memory and executive functioning.
              Results:
              As predicted, all cognitive subtests and factors showed very small but significant declines over 9 years, with differences in the timing and extent of change. Processing speed showed the earliest and steepest decrements. Those with higher educational attainment scored better on all tests except reaction time. Men had better executive functioning and women performed better on episodic memory.
              Conclusions:
              Examining cognitive changes in midlife provides opportunities for early detection of cognitive impairments and possibilities for preventative interventions. (

	abstract = {This article reviews the cognitive changes that occur with normal aging, the structural and functional correlates of these cognitive changes, and the prevalence and cognitive effects of age-associated diseases. Understanding these age-related changes in cognition is important given our growing elderly population and the importance of cognition in maintaining functional independence and effective communication with others. The most important changes in cognition with normal aging are declines in performance on cognitive tasks that require one to quickly process or transform information to make a decision, including measures of speed of processing, working memory, and executive cognitive function. Cumulative knowledge and experiential skills are well maintained into advanced age. Structural and function changes in the brain correlate with these age-related cognitive changes, including alterations in neuronal structure without neuronal death, loss of synapses, and dysfunction of neuronal networks. Age-related diseases accelerate the rate of neuronal dysfunction, neuronal loss, and cognitive decline, with many persons developing cognitive impairments severe enough to impair their everyday functional abilities. There is emerging evidence that healthy lifestyles may decrease the rate of cognitive decline seen with aging and help delay the onset of cognitive symptoms in the setting of age-associated diseases.},

	abstract = {Background  Physical and cognitive function are both indicators of aging, characterized by a loss of adaptive response to life challenges and functional limitations, subsequently affecting their quality of life. This study aimed to identify the direct effect of physical function and the indirect effect of cognitive function on the quality of life in older adults with mild cognitive impairment.
Methods  The study participants were 79 older adults recruited from community centers in four urban districts of Korea. All participants completed a self-reported questionnaire for demographic characteristics and outcome variables. Outcome measures included physical function (grip strength, balance, and mobility), cognitive function, and mental and physical components of quality of life (QOL). Statistical analyses were conducted using hierarchical multiple linear regression and the PROCESS macro for mediation analysis.
Results  The mean age of participants was 77.46 years old with an elementary or lower education level (53.2\%). The mean score of cognitive function was 16.39 (SD = 6.5). Physical function (grip strength, balance, mobility) and cognitive function explained 25\% of the variance in physical (p = 0.004) and 29\% in mental (p {\textless} 0.001) components of QOL after controlling for age, sex, and education level. Mobility was associated with both physical (β=-0.27, p = 0.024) and mental (β=-0.36, p = 0.002) components of QOL. The cognitive function partially mediated the relationship between balance and the physical component of QOL; the proportion of mediation was 55\%.
Conclusion  In conclusion, physical and cognitive function were significant predictors of QOL in older adults with cognitive impairment. Specifically, balance has significant indirect effects on the physical component of QOL through cognitive function as a mediator. Health-promoting strategies could be more effective when focusing on the direct effect of physical function as well as the mediating effect of cognitive function to promote the quality of life in this population.},

	abstract = {Aging populations, increased incidence of chronic disease, technological advances, health-care consumerism, and rapidly escalating health care costs are driving health care into the home. Advances in the miniaturization and portability of diagnostic technologies, information technologies, remote monitoring, and long-distance care have increased the viability of home-based care. The ability of older adults to use e-health tools is a critical issue, because such tools could effectively enhance medical care for this population. However, fear of technology is more prevalent among older generations who did not grow up with computers, complicated acronyms or digital games. This paper introduces the Health Education Learning Program with Science for seniors (HELPS-seniors) program, which encourages subjects to use new self-management tools for technophobic elderly people. We then explain how to integrate HELPS-senior into a health professional service learning program, and how to train students to become empathetic and smart health promoters. The present findings support the development of service-learning projects within medical education to overcome the technophobia among the elderly.},

To fulfill the need of accumulating older adult learners, the current research comprehensively incorporates all targetspecific elements related to the process of digital learning for older adults. Particularly, the unified model highlights barrier factors and offers insights into the nature of their paradoxical hesitation towards technology.
Methods: In this study, a total of 20 older adults (mean age 63.85 and 25\% male) were interviewed. Interviews were recorded for thorough analysis. The coding framework guided data analysis to achieve research objectives.
Results: The findings revealed that: (1) social influence was found as older adults’ major precursor of exposure to digital technology; (2) both acceptance and barrier factors emerged regarding older adults’ digital learning; (3) older adults feature paradoxical hesitation towards technology; (4) three types of senior digital learners were identified: tech-native learners; tech-novice learners; tech-rejector learners.
Conclusions: The unified model of the paradox of older adults’ digital learning was created, highlighting barrier factors and offers insights into the nature of their paradoxical hesitation towards technology. This study contributes a reference for elderly digital learning field and serving the accumulated number of older adult learners.},

	abstract = {Intergenerational contact for technology learning frequently transpires in various daily settings of older adults’ lives. However, older adults often hold negative age-based self-stereotype that they are less capable in technology use. Thus, they may experience age-based stereotype threats in such situations, which further induce techno­ phobia. Previous research indicated that positive intergenerational contact can reduce age-based stereotype threat and technophobia among older adults. This research focuses on intergenerational physical proximity, a vital role in structuring intergenerational contact, to investigate how it impacts technophobia via age-based stereotype threat among older adults. In addition, the moderating effect of key attributes of technology—new­ ness and ease of use were explored. A vignette experiment was conducted with a sample of 243 older adults. Results show that more distant intergenerational physical proximity led to lower technophobia-personal failure dimension via more positive self-perception of aging (a manifestation of less age-based stereotype threat) when the technology is of high newness and low ease of use. However, the effect of physical proximity on technophobia was insignificant when the technology is of low newness, or of high newness but high ease of use. The findings of this research can provide detailed and practical suggestions on how to reduce technophobia among older adults through effective intergenerational contact.},

Using a laboratory experiment with 81participants aged 57 to 85, our results supported past research and showed the inﬂuence of cognitive map formation on readers’ feelings of fatigue. We contributed empirical evidence to the contention that reading on a screen could match that of reading from paper if the presentation of the text on screen resemble that of the print. Our ﬁndings also suggested that individual levels of technophobia was an important barrier to older adults’ effective use of mobile technologies for reading. In the post hoc analyses, we further showed that technophobia was correlated with technology experience, certain personality traits, and age. The present study highlights the importance of providing tailored support that helps older adults overcome psychological obstacles in using technologies.},

Despite the numerous beneﬁts of ICT, older adults still present low rates of ICT adoption compared to other population segments. The lack of accessible User Interfaces has been identiﬁed as a major barrier. Traditional User Interfaces follow a design for all approach, typically ignoring the needs of older adults. Recent research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) proposes adaptive User Interfaces to suit the individual users abilities. Nevertheless, most of the existing approaches perform adaptation based on user proﬁle groups and do not provide personalized adaptation in real-time. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for developing real-time adaptive User Interfaces. The system aims to target most common issues among older adults, i.e. cognitive decline and vision loss. The developed conceptual framework also presents novel strategic techniques to assess cognitive load and vision related issues in an unobtrusive manner for the user.},

These recommendations are the result of iterative design, testing, and development of a TV-based health system for older adults that aims to provide a holistic solution to improve quality of life for older adults with chronic conditions by fostering their autonomy and reducing hospitalization costs. The authors’ work and experience shows that widely known UI design guidelines unsurprisingly apply to the design of TV-based applications for older adults, but acquire a crucial importance in this context.},

Studies have shown that nostalgic memories trigger positive emotions, which can provide better experiences for elderly people in learning and using new technology. However, the use of nostalgia in TUI for elderly people has been little and therefore the understanding on how nostalgia can contribute in TUI promoting technology acceptance among elderly people is limited. In order to address this knowledge gap, in this study we have created a nostalgic TUI application for elderly people through three iterations of design, development and evaluation. The results show that by adopting the element of nostalgia into the TUI application, elderly people could learn to use new technology in a more intuitive way. They could relate the new technology to their old positive memories. However, they had expectations that the TUI application would work exactly like the old fashioned way. Through the research process, we gathered and reﬂected on the lessons learned, which can serve as guidelines for using the concept of nostalgia in designing TUI application for elderly people’s technology acceptance.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, information and communication technologies (ICT) have become part of our everyday life, enhancing the quality of life and promoting new forms of social interaction. Despite the numerous beneﬁts of ICT, older adults still present low rates of ICT adoption compared to other population segments. The lack of accessible User Interfaces has been identiﬁed as a major barrier. Traditional User Interfaces follow a design for all approach, typically ignoring the needs of older adults. Recent research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) proposes adaptive User Interfaces to suit the individual users abilities. Nevertheless, most of the existing approaches perform adaptation based on user proﬁle groups and do not provide personalized adaptation in real-time. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for developing real-time adaptive User Interfaces. The system aims to target most common issues among older adults, i.e. cognitive decline and vision loss. The developed conceptual framework also presents novel strategic techniques to assess cognitive load and vision related issues in an unobtrusive manner for the user.},

The Easier web system provides a tool that assists in the understanding and readability of text content geared towards people with intellectual disabilities. It detects complex words and offers easier replacements and other resources such as a definition of the complex word. In addition to applying the design patterns, user tests with people with intellectual disabilities and older people have been carried out to evaluate the cognitive accessibility of the Easier system's interface. The results indicate that people with cognitive impairments know how to use the interfaces and have a satisfactory experience. In addition, a design proposal to provide a glossary mechanism to be used in web interfaces with simplified texts is presented and validated.},

Mobile UIs not only pack a ton of features in a small screen but also get frequent updates to their visual layouts—thereby exacerbating the problem. This paper explores a design solution where users could search for a UI feature using spoken-word queries. We investigated: 1) what type of questions older users ask when facing interaction challenges in unfamiliar scenarios, 2) how those query types compare with younger users’ inquiries, and 3) how older adults use a voice assistant design probe in a Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) study. Results reveal five query types when verbally articulating interaction issues: validation, directed and undirected informational, navigational, and conceptual. In the WoZ study, older users typically asked for help following a series of non-unique or off-task feature selections (n = 13/15), and in 77\% of those instances, they completed the task in the next interaction.},

	abstract = {Myriad medical advances and lengthening human longevity increasingly draw our focus toward ways to stay healthy. Healthcare management systems, both videos and apps, prosper now in the marketplace under that focus. Usability and interfaces have been identiﬁed as two critical components of these systems, yet to date, few studies have focused on improving these components for older users, who comprise a unique, expanding ethnic group. This study aimed to integrate both objective and subjective perspectives to analyze a health management system’s usability and its interface for senior. We developed an integrative usability metrics set collating both psychological and physiological data. An empirical study veriﬁed a resulting improvement of the system and its interface. Results showed more consistent data when the system user’s cognition was positive with respect to usability. Suggestions for enhancing the system’s usability among the older persons are given.},

While these devices are increasingly being used to cover health needs, there are not sufficient studies addressing usability of smartphone user interfaces for older adults. This paper describes the design and evaluation process of the user interface of a smartphone application designed to promote exercise and prevent falls amongst older adults.

The results and findings from three rounds of usability tests led to recommendations regarding inclusive design and designing for older adults that may be a useful contribution to the broader community when designing interfaces for smartphones.},

Such difficulties often lead to triggering usability problems for the elderly when interacting with the smartphone UI. In this study, we present a design framework for fabricating smartphones with usable UIs for elderly users. We developed a frameworkbased prototype and experimentally compared the usability of the prototype’s UI design with that of an Android-based UI. We considered the summative concept of usability based on the measurements of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction of the elderly. Twelve elderly participants were given tasks to perform on the Android and prototype, and their performances (in terms of effectiveness and efficiency) and satisfaction were measured. We measured the effectiveness using the task completion rate, the efficiency using the task completion time and the participants’ satisfaction using the After-Scenario Questionnaire. The results showed that the design of the prototype UI outperformed the design of its Android counterpart in most aspects of the participants’ performances and their satisfaction. The design framework has shown to be an effective tool for fabricating smartphones with usable UI designs for the elderly.},

A first step to standardizing is to have an overview of how experts-based usability evaluation studies are reported across the literature. Objectives: to describe and synthesize the procedures of usability evaluation by experts that are being reported to conduct inspection usability assessments of digital solutions relevant for older adults. Methods: a scoping review of reviews was performed using a five-stage methodology to identify and describe relevant literature published between 2009 and 2020 as follows: i) identification of the research question; ii) identification of relevant studies; iii) select studies for review; iv) charting of data from selected literature; and v) collation, summary, and report of results. The research was conducted on five electronic databases: PubMed, ACM Digital Library, IEEE, Scopus, and Web of Science. The articles that met the inclusion criteria were identified, and data extracted for further analysis, including evaluators, current usability inspection methods, and instruments to support usability inspection methods. Results: a total of 3958 articles were identified. After a detailed screening, 12 reviews matched the eligibility criteria. Conclusion: overall, we found a variety of unstandardized procedures and a lack of detail on some important aspects of the assessment, including a thorough description of the evaluators and of the instruments used to facilitate the inspection evaluation such as heuristics checklists.},

Observations involved two sessions for each user: first, a naturalistic observation where the researcher recorded the participant interacting with the computer(s) in their home, demonstrating their typical internet use; second, a structured task analysis where participants completed a series of increasingly complex operations online, including searching for information on a specific topic, using web mapping tools, and interacting with a government website. Participants followed a think-aloud protocol during both observations, explaining the steps that they were taking and sharing their thought process and feelings with the researcher. The rich qualitative data from this work provides insights into the needs of this population in four specific areas—physical, cognitive, educational, and cultural—as well as design strategies for addressing those needs.},

The older adults are generally perceived as techno-phobic, and this poses challenges for them to adopt some advanced features on smartphones. Moreover, smartphones and some mobile apps are not designed to meet the needs and expectations of older adults. This hinders them from fully utilizing their functions and services. A mobile-user interaction study was conducted to examine the usability of smartphone user interface and mobile apps among 80 older adults. The 4 tasks were ‘making and retrieving voice calls’, ‘using phone book’, ‘installing a mobile app from Google Play Store’, and ‘using WhatsApp’. The usability result revealed that the ‘voice call’ task had the highest success task completion rate (83.44\%), followed by phonebook (70.16\%), mobile app (63.13\%) and using WhatsApp (60.42\%). To conclude, majority faced problems downloading a mobile app from Play Store. Although WhatsApp is their favourite communication app, it reveals the usability problems of using features such as sending audio recording ﬁles. They feared of upgrading their apps as they were not familiar with the notiﬁcations. There is still some room to improve issues in smartphone user interface design especially for older adults’ cohort.},

The present study is aiming to understand older Hong Kong people’s emotions elicited by using assistive technology. A qualitative research method was adopted in the current study. Face-to-face interviews and focused groups were conducted with 50 community-dwelling older adults in Elderly Services Centers in Hong Kong. Results indicate that the assistive technology experienced by older people include mobile phones, walking aids, hearing aids, emergency alarm services and computers. Older people have both positive and negative emotional responses in regards to assistive technology. Assistive technology has the potential to provide safety and secure and reduce risks for older people. However, it may also elicit negative emotions such as anxiety, frustrating, prejudice and discrimination. To increase an optimal user experience, we need to pay more attention to older users’ emotional and psychological needs besides usability, and to adopt a positive and integrated design approach during assistive technology development. Several design suggestions were provided based on the results.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Immersive virtual reality has tremendous potential to improve cognition in populations with cognitive impairment. We conducted a feasibility and proof-of-concept study to assess the potential of virtual reality and electroencephalography, with or without an intelligent agent, that adapts the presented material to the emotions elicited by the environment.
Method: Older adults with subjective cognitive decline recruited from the community received a virtual reality-based intervention taking place in one of two virtual environments, a train (Part 1, N 19) or a music theatre, complemented by the intelligent agent (Part 2, N 19). A comparative control group (N 19) receiving no intervention was also included. All participants completed measures of affect and cognition before and after the intervention. The intervention groups completed measures of cybersickness and user experience after the intervention.
Results: Participants did not suffer from increased cybersickness following either intervention. They also reported a positive to highly positive user experience concerning the following aspects: attractivity, hedonic quality-identity and hedonic quality-stimulation. The measures of affect showed no pre-post change when comparing either intervention to the control condition. However, a reduction of negative affect was observed following the train intervention for participants with a high self-reported negative affect at baseline. Finally, there was a signiﬁcant improvement in working memory when comparing either intervention group to the control condition.
Conclusion: Our results support the feasibility and tolerability of the technology, and a positive impact on cognition, paving the way for a larger-scale randomized clinical trial to conﬁrm efﬁcacy.},

In addition to developing technology to support physical health, there is an increasing recognition of the need to consider how technology can support emotional health. This raises the question of how to design devices that older adults can interact with to log their emotions.
Objective: We designed and developed 2 novel tangible devices, inspired by existing paper-based scales of emotions. The findings from a field trial of these devices with older adults are reported.
Methods: Using interviews, field deployment, and fixed logging tasks, we assessed the developed devices.
Results: Our results demonstrate that the tangible devices provided data comparable with standardized psychological scales of emotion. The participants developed their own patterns of use around the devices, and their experience of using the devices uncovered a variety of design considerations. We discuss the difficulty of customizing devices for specific user needs while logging data comparable to psychological scales of emotion. We also highlight the value of reflecting on sparse emotional data.
Conclusions: Our work demonstrates the potential for tangible emotional logging devices. It also supports further research on whether such devices can support the emotional health of older adults by encouraging reflection of their emotional state.},

The simulated robot study examined the positive and negative emotions and the attitudes of 142 older adults toward robots in different situations and with robots of different appearances. The situation inﬂuenced both emotions and attitudes. The older adults expressed more negative emotions and a more negative attitude in a care situation. In terms of appearance, less uncanniness and higher usage intention for the human-like and android robot were reported. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of robot acceptance and should be considered in the development of service robots for older adults in the future.

	abstract = {Older adults want to live independently in their home for as long as possible, and technologies can support them with this goal. However, solutions to help with living alone are often designed from a technical perspective, ignoring the needs and preferences of older adults. This results in strong attitudes and feelings against, and limited adoption of, these technologies. In this chapter, the authors use ethnographic methods to inform the development of solutions taking into account the emotional needs of end-users. They present a three-staged approach by applying it in the domain of personal emergency alarms. First, the authors identify the shortcomings of current emergency alarm systems as perceived by older adults. Then, they develop a prototype that addresses some of the issues identified, focusing on emotional needs. Finally, the authors conduct a trial with the prototype. The results show that considering emotions during system design can improve user experience.},

The present study is aiming to understand older Hong Kong people’s emotions elicited by using assistive technology. A qualitative research method was adopted in the current study. Face-to-face interviews and focused groups were conducted with 50 community-dwelling older adults in Elderly Services Centers in Hong Kong. Results indicate that the assistive technology experienced by older people include mobile phones, walking aids, hearing aids, emergency alarm services and computers. Older people have both positive and negative emotional responses in regards to assistive technology. Assistive technology has the potential to provide safety and secure and reduce risks for older people. However, it may also elicit negative emotions such as anxiety, frustrating, prejudice and discrimination. To increase an optimal user experience, we need to pay more attention to older users’ emotional and psychological needs besides usability, and to adopt a positive and integrated design approach during assistive technology development. Several design suggestions were provided based on the results.},

	abstract = {Background: The global population is aging, leading to shifts in health care needs. In addition to developing technology to support physical health, there is an increasing recognition of the need to consider how technology can support emotional health. This raises the question of how to design devices that older adults can interact with to log their emotions.
Objective: We designed and developed 2 novel tangible devices, inspired by existing paper-based scales of emotions. The findings from a field trial of these devices with older adults are reported.
Methods: Using interviews, field deployment, and fixed logging tasks, we assessed the developed devices.
Results: Our results demonstrate that the tangible devices provided data comparable with standardized psychological scales of emotion. The participants developed their own patterns of use around the devices, and their experience of using the devices uncovered a variety of design considerations. We discuss the difficulty of customizing devices for specific user needs while logging data comparable to psychological scales of emotion. We also highlight the value of reflecting on sparse emotional data.
Conclusions: Our work demonstrates the potential for tangible emotional logging devices. It also supports further research on whether such devices can support the emotional health of older adults by encouraging reflection of their emotional state.},

With ageing, there is a natural decay of the sensory, cognitive and physical levels. The affective level, in contrast, becomes a stronger component of users’ capabilities, compared to the other three levels. However, unless a vigilant design process that addresses older adults’ requirements is in place, the consequences of sensory, cognitive and physical ageing result in a slow-paced, hesitant interaction and an unsatisfying user experience. This work focuses on better understanding older adults’ needs, capabilities and attitudes, and emphasizes the necessity to design for their inclusion by involving this user group in human factors activities throughout the medical device development process.},

	abstract = {In recent years, an increased demand for improving mental health and well-being led to developing procedures capable of enhancing positive experiences. One highly attractive candidate for evoking positive experiences is Virtual Reality (VR), as VR enables users to experience various situations in controlled and safe environments. This overview ﬁrst investigates how positive emotions, well-being and VR are interconnected. Then, an overview about how and why to induce positive emotions in adult users is provided. Methodological and ethical considerations about VR technology, measurements of VR’s efﬁcacy and user characteristics are reviewed. It emerges that VR is efﬁcient in inducing positive emotions across the adult lifespan and in various settings. Levels of immersion, interactivity, Virtual environment contents, sensory modalities involved and users’ characteristics emerged as key determinants for successfully inducing positive emotions with VR. The main applications of positive VR experiences consist in using VR for relaxation, stress and pain management, motivation for physical activities, and gives promising results for apathy treatment in elderly users. Although VR is efﬁcient in eliciting positive emotions and experiences, the underlying operating mechanisms remain unclear and are yet to be further investigated. Finally, the need for a user-centered approach when designing positive VR experiences, clear guidelines for the use of VR, and a better documentation of its potential adverse effects are addressed.},

Observations involved two sessions for each user: first, a naturalistic observation where the researcher recorded the participant interacting with the computer(s) in their home, demonstrating their typical internet use; second, a structured task analysis where participants completed a series of increasingly complex operations online, including searching for information on a specific topic, using web mapping tools, and interacting with a government website. Participants followed a think-aloud protocol during both observations, explaining the steps that they were taking and sharing their thought process and feelings with the researcher.

Yet, there has no similar model been tested among older adults. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the mediating role of hope agency and pathways in the association between positive emotions and life satisfaction. Three hundred and forty-one Chinese community-dwelling older adults (mean = 70.83, SD = 9.16) were asked to complete a survey questionnaire comprising measures assessing positive emotions, hope, life satisfaction, and other sociodemographic variables. Results showed that hope agency, but not hope pathways, partially mediated the relationship between positive emotions and life satisfaction.

	abstract = {Background: By watching 360° videos in virtual reality headsets, students may experience being immersed in the portrayed situation. There is a paucity of empirical studies on the application of immersive 360° videos watched in virtual reality headsets for students in health care and social work education and the pedagogical theory guiding the development of such educational tools. This led to our interest in exploring how a virtual reality educational tool involving 360° videos can stimulate emotions and how this can be used as a pedagogical tool in these educational programs.
Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of faculty members and students regarding a prototype 360° video watched in virtual reality headsets during the development phase of an educational project. We addressed the following research questions: How does the virtual reality prototype stimulate emotions? How can virtual reality be used in higher education for health care and social work students?
Methods: We used a qualitative design and collected data through focus group interviews with project participants. The data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.
Results: Our analysis identified 2 main themes in participants’ experiences with the virtual reality prototype. The first theme highlights that when participants experienced watching the 360° video in a virtual reality headset, it stimulated their emotions as an authentic professional experience would. The second theme, contextualization of virtual reality, highlights participants’ perceptions of how the virtual reality experience should be incorporated into a safe educational context.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that 360° videos with human actors who use eye contact with the camera can trigger emotions in the viewer and therefore serve as a pedagogic tool that can create authentic professional experiences for students. The participants expressed the view that the virtual reality educational tool could be used to prepare students for real-life practice in health care and social work. However, they underlined that 360° videos in virtual reality need to be contextualized in educational programs to create a safe environment for learning and to ensure follow-up on the emotions such experiences can trigger in students. Our results highlight the perceived importance of allowing students to reflect on the virtual reality experience in a safe setting and of follow-up by faculty members. In-person follow-up with students can be resource intensive for programs with large numbers of students and makes it challenging to offer repeated training, something that has been identified as one of the benefits of virtual reality.},

There is, nonetheless, an empirical gap regarding the role of the intrinsic emotional ﬂuctuations in social platforms and their eﬀect on self-disclosure behaviour, reﬂecting information to self-reports. The current study aims an in-depth understanding of an ‘outdated’ online social environment (Second Life) with a contemporary one (Facebook), based on users’ emotional behaviour and approaches. The study’s overarching aim is to determine the self-disclosure behaviour through Second Life and Facebook, thus investigating the highlighted emotional experience and providing insights for understanding the progression of enhancing online well-being. The empirical study was conducted, by implementing explanatory mix methods to achieve the study’s objectives. Self-disclosure behaviour can shed light on how emotional responses might be used in other social media platforms by opening up the discussion for further exploration [in line with Pentina and Zhang (2017). “Eﬀects of Social Support and Personality on Emotional Disclosure on Facebook and in Real Life.” Behaviour \& Information Technology 36 (5): 484–492.].

	abstract = {This paper assesses the impact of emotional arousal on learning through a virtual reality video of geography immersion learning. Validity was measured with traditional questionnaire data and using electroencephalography (EEG). Twenty-four human subjects were recruited and presented with eight geography immersive learning videos with different affective tendencies. EEG data of the subjects were collected while they were watching the videos. After the video watching, subjects were requested to ﬁll in an emotion scale, a learning motivation scale, and a mind ﬂow experience. The results of the study show that VR video learning materials can well induce the positive and negative emotions of the subjects. Compared with negative emotions, the alpha band power in the frontal lobe of the brain, beta and gamma bands in the temporal lobe region is signiﬁcantly higher under positive emotions. In addition, the results of the subjective scales indicate that subjects have stronger intrinsic motivations and better ﬂow experiences under positive emotions. However, there was no signiﬁcant difference for the immersion under positive and negative emotions. Our ﬁndings demonstrate the usability of teaching virtual reality situational geography stories and the broad value of using this teaching method for future instruction.},

College students (N ϭ 118) were randomly assigned to 4 conditions created by 2 factors related to learners’ emotion: external mood induction (positive vs. neutral emotions) and emotional design induction (positive vs. neutral emotions). A computer-based lesson on the topic of immunization was used as multimedia learning material. Results indicate that applying emotional design principles to learning materials can induce positive emotions and that positive emotions in multimedia-based learning facilitate cognitive processes and learning. Controlling for the germane load of the materials, the internal induction of positive emotions through design of the materials increased comprehension and transfer, whereas the external induction of positive emotions through mood induction enhanced transfer but not comprehension. Positive emotions induced through mood induction significantly increased the amount of learners’ reported mental effort, whereas positive emotional design reduced the perceived difficulty of the learning task. Positive emotions increased motivation, satisfaction, and perception toward the materials. Mediation analyses suggest that the effect of positive emotions induced externally was mediated by both motivation and mental effort but found no mediators for emotion induced via emotional design, suggesting that positive emotional design has a more direct impact on learning than externally induced emotions. The study suggests that emotions should be considered an important factor in the design of multimedia learning materials.},

	abstract = {An ageing population is a universal phenomenon experienced worldwide. In parallel with these demographic changes, a significant breakthrough in digital devices has also influenced this digital age. Designing instructional strategies to promote meaningful learning among older adult learners has been a long-standing challenge. To enhance older adults’ life-long learning experiences, implementing instructional strategies in the process through which such adults learn can help to improve effective learning. Despite significant calls for research in this area, there is still insufficient research that systematically reviews the existing literature on older adult learning needs and preferences. Hence, in the present article, a systematic literature review was conducted of the effectiveness of instructional strategies designed for older adult learners through the use of digital technologies. The review was guided by the publication standard, which is ROSES (Reporting Standard for Systematic Evidence Syntheses). This study involves articles selected from two established databases, Web of Science and Scopus. Data from the articles were then analysed using the thematic analysis, which resulted in six main themes: (1) collaborative learning; (2) informal learning setting; (3) teaching aids; (4) pertinence; (5) lesson design; and (6) obtaining and providing feedback. The six main themes produced a further 15 sub-themes. The results from this study make significant contributions in the areas of instructional design and gerontology. The findings from this study highlight several important strategies of teaching digital technology, particularly for older adults, as follows: (1) to enhance instructional design use in teaching digital technology based on the needs and preferences of older adult learners; and (2) to highlight the factors for, and impact of, learning digital technologies among older adults.},

The elderly living in the community seek alternative and complementary methods to improve their diet and quality of life. This study aimed to investigate the impact of an educational intervention on knowledge related to healthy eating among older adults. This intervention is rooted in the principles of meaningful learning and incorporates culturally adapted materials. A quasi-experimental study design was employed using a pre-test–post-test control group. Study participants were a total of 109 elderly (intervention: n = 51, control: n = 58) people in Cuenca, Ecuador. The educational intervention based on Ausubel’s theory of signiﬁcant learning and Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory was programmed to be carried out for one session per week, over 24 weeks, with a duration of 120 min per session. The measures were the general characteristics of the study participants and knowledge about necessary amounts, food sources and the consequences of deﬁcits or excesses in the consumption of macro- and micronutrients. Data were collected from August 2018 to February 2019. Statistically signiﬁcant differences were observed between the intervention group (IG) and the control group (CG) in terms of knowledge about healthy eating for older adults following the educational intervention. The outcomes of this study strongly suggest the efﬁcacy of the program in improving knowledge related to healthy eating among older adults. Healthcare providers should prioritize food education based on meaningful learning, utilizing culturally adapted materials for the elderly individuals residing within the community.},

On the other hand, more than 70\% of seniors in Republic of Korea use the internet, and 55\% in Singapore had access to it in 2019. The use of digital technology for health promotion has the potential to promote individual and community empowerment, advocating for healthy, active aging. Maintaining equity in health promotion practice requires the digital inclusion of every senior. Therefore, we propose a cross-cultural study to explain the contextual inﬂuences of digital inclusion and its consequences on healthy aging in Japan, Korea, Singapore, and Thailand. Quantitatively: digital skills, e-health literacy, participation in health promotion, and quality of life will be analyzed in structural equation models. Qualitatively: thematic analysis will be developed to identify cultural patterns and contextual factors, making sense of what older persons in different countries materialize, say, do, think, and feel to reveal deeper beliefs and core values about digital inclusion and healthy aging. Logics and methods from this protocol would be useful to replicate the study in many countries globally. Evidence from this study is expected to pave the way to digitally inclusive, healthy aging communities (DIHAC) across Japan and Asia.},

	abstract = {Smart technologies (e.g., smartphones, smart security technologies, digital home assistants) have advanced over the years and will continue to do so. There are various beneﬁts to using these technologies in one’s life, such as an increase in productivity through automation and self-monitoring one’s health. Older adults particularly may beneﬁt from smart technologies to support their everyday activities and compensate for age related changes. In this study, we explored the experiences and attitudes of eighty older adults including those who had prior experience and those who had never used (or perhaps never heard of) smart technologies through an online survey. We assessed their general opinions toward using smart technology and explored what facilitated or hindered their use. Older adults rated the facilitators to use for each smart technology differently, with few commonalities between the order of the most agreed upon facilitators. However, older adults’ opinions were consistent across each technology about their ignorance of technological features and cost of the smart technology, which could be potential barriers to use. Among those who had never used one of the smart technologies, privacy was the most commonly endorsed concern. The results from this study support the understanding of key considerations when developing and deploying smart technologies for older adults.},

	abstract = {Background: Digital technologies facilitate everyday life, social connectedness, aging at home, well-being, and dignified care. However, older adults are disproportionately excluded from these benefits. Equal digital opportunities, access, and meaningful engagement require an understanding of older adults’ experience across different stages of the technological engagement life cycle from nonuse and initial adoption to sustained use, factors influencing their decisions, and how the experience changes over time.
Objective: Our objectives were to identify the extent and breadth of existing literature on older adults’ perspective on digital engagement and summarize the barriers to and facilitators for technological nonuse, initial adoption, and sustained digital technology engagement.
Methods: We used the Arksey and O’Malley framework for the scoping review process. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and ACM digital library for primary studies published between 2005 and 2021. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed based on the Joanna Briggs Institute (participants, content, and context) framework. Studies that investigated the digital engagement experience as well as barriers to and facilitators of older adults’ digital technology engagement were included. The characteristics of the study, types of digital technology, and digital engagement levels were analyzed descriptively. Content analysis was used to generate tentative elements using a congruent theme, and barriers and facilitators were mapped over the capability, opportunity, and motivation behavior change model (COM-B) and the theoretical domain framework. The findings were reported in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews).
Results: In total, 96 publications were eligible for the final charting and synthesis. Most of the studies were published over the past 5 years, investigated the initial adoption stage of digital engagement, and focused on everyday technologies. The most cited barriers and facilitators across the engagement stages from each COM-B component were capability (eg, physical and psychological changes and lack of skill), opportunity (eg, technological features, environmental context, and resources), and motivation (eg, optimism from perceived usefulness and beliefs about capability).
Conclusions: The COM-B model and theoretical domain framework provide a guide for identifying multiple and intertwined barriers and facilitators at each stage of digital engagement. There are limited studies looking into the whole spectrum of older adults’ digital technology experience; in particular, studies on technological nonuse and sustained use stages are rare. Future research and practice should focus on tailored interventions accounting for the barriers to older adults’ digital engagement and addressing capabilities, motivation, and opportunities; affordable, usable, and useful digital technologies, which address the changes and capability requirements of older adults and are cocreated with a value framework; and lifelong learning and empowerment to develop older adults’ knowledge and skills to cope with digital technology development.},

The purpose of this paper is to synthesize using inductive thematic analysis the literature on broader health and social impacts on older adults from lockdown-related measures caused by the pandemic. The ﬁndings consisted of three dichotomous themes regarding older adults’ barriers and facilitators to technology. The ﬁrst theme centers on personal belief and perception of oneself. The second theme explores the digital literacy continuum. The third theme focuses on older adults’ barriers and facilitators when adopting technology.

	abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift toward the digital provision of many public services, including health and social care, public administration, and financial and leisure services. COVID-19 services including test appointments, results, vaccination appointments and more were primarily delivered through digital channels to the public. Many social, cultural, and economic activities (appointments, ticket bookings, tax and utility payments, shopping, etc) have transitioned to web-based platforms. To use web-based public services, individuals must be digitally included. This is influenced by 3 main factors: access (whether individuals have access to the internet), ability (having the requisite skills and confidence to participate over the web), and affordability (ability to pay for infrastructure [equipment] and data packages). Many older adults, especially those aged {\textgreater}75 years, are still digitally excluded.
Objective: This study aims to explore the views of adults aged {\textgreater}75 years on accessing public services digitally.
Methods: We conducted semistructured qualitative interviews with a variety of adults aged ≥75 years residing in Greater Manchester, United Kingdom. We also interviewed community support workers. Thematic analysis was used to identify the key themes from the data.
Results: Overall, 24 older adults (mean age 81, SD 4.54 y; 14/24, 58\% female; 23/24, 96\% White British; and 18/24, 75\% digitally engaged to some extent) and 2 support workers participated. A total of five themes were identified as key in understanding issues around motivation, engagement, and participation: (1) “initial motivation to participate digitally”—for example, maintaining social connections and gaining skills to be able to connect with family and friends; (2) “narrow use and restricted activity on the web”—undertaking limited tasks on the web and in a modified manner, for example, limited use of web-based public services and selected use of specific services, such as checking but never transferring funds during web-based banking; (3) “impact of digital participation on well-being”—choosing to go to the shops or general practitioner’s surgery to get out of the house and get some exercise; (4) “the last generation?”—respondents feeling that there were generational barriers to adapting to new technology and change; and (5) “making digital accessible”—understanding the support needed to keep those engaged on the web.
Conclusions: As we transition toward greater digitalization of public services, it is crucial to incorporate the perspectives of older people. Failing to do so risks excluding them from accessing services they greatly rely on and need.},

	abstract = {Background: Limited attention has been paid to how and why older adults choose to engage with technologyfacilitated health care (e-health), and the factors that impact on this. This scoping review sought to address this gap.
Methods: Databases were searched for papers reporting on the use of e-health services by older adults, defined as being aged 60 years or older, with specific reference to barriers and facilitators to e-health use.
Result: 14 papers were included and synthesised into five thematic categories and related subthemes. Results are discussed with reference to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology2. The most prevalent barriers to e-health engagement were a lack of self-efficacy, knowledge, support, functionality, and information provision about the benefits of e-health for older adults. Key facilitators were active engagement of the target end users in the design and delivery of e-health programs, support for overcoming concerns privacy and enhancing self-efficacy in the use of technology, and integration of e-health programs across health services to accommodate the multimorbidity with which older adults typically present.
Conclusion: E-health offers a potential solution to overcome the barriers faced by older adults to access timely, effective, and acceptable health care for physical and mental health. However, unless the barriers and facilitators identified in this review are addressed, this potential will not be realised.},

              Digital exclusion, through lack of access and poor digital skills, can have an adverse impact on daily living. Not only did the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically impact the necessity of technology in our daily lives, but also reduced the availability of digital skills programmes. This study aimed to explore perceived facilitators and barriers of a digital skills programme that was delivered remotely (online) and to reflect on this form of training as a possible alternative to traditional face-to-face models.

	abstract = {While Lithuania advances rapidly in the ICT sector, a digital divide persists among older adults. A study of 289 elderly Internet users highlighted key barriers and facilitators in digital engagement. Motivation stemmed from personal qualities like curiosity and past work experience with digital tools. Major barriers included language challenges, technical jargon, limited support, device comprehension issues, and emotional factors. Formal and informal training, peer support, gaming‘s role, and family, particularly younger members, emerged as crucial learning aids. The study underscores the need for strategies tailored to enhance digital inclusion of older people in Lithuania.

            Lietuvoje informacinių komunikacinių technologijų (IKT) sparti kaita vyksta paraleliai su gana dideliu vyresnio amžiaus žmonių skaitmeninio dalyvavimo atotrūkiu. Remiantis Kebede ir kt. (2022) apibendrintu teoriniu modeliu, straipsnyje siekta ištirti vyresnio amžiaus žmonių skaitmeninio įsitraukimo kliūtis ir jį lengvinančius veiksnius. Buvo atlikta vyresnio amžiaus interneto vartotojų nereprezentatyvi internetinė apklausa (N=289). Remiantis tyrimo rezultatais, asmeninės savybės, tokios kaip smalsumas ir ryžtas, buvo didžiausia paskata mokytis IKT. Ankstesnė darbo su skaitmeninėmis priemonėmis patirtis palengvino jų naudojimą vyresniame amžiuje. Tyrimo duomenų analizė parodė, kad dominuojančios kliūtys naudotis IKT susijusios su reflektyvios motyvacijos ir galimybių kategorijomis. Anglų kalbos nemokėjimas ir techninio žargono nesupratimas buvo pagrindinės kliūtys. Kiti reikšmingi barjerai – ribota techninė pagalba, įrenginių veikimo principų supratimo problemos, mentorystės trūkumas. Emocinės kliūtys, tokios, kaip klaidų baimė, nesaugumas ir mokymosi sunkumai, taip pat kėlė iššūkių. Skaitmeninį įtrauktumą skatinančių veiksnių analizė atskleidė formalaus ir neformalaus mokymo svarbą, bendraamžių pagalbos, žaidimų vaidmenį mokyme. Šeima, ypač vaikai ir anūkai, vaidino esminį vaidmenį mokantis. Nors asmeninė motyvacija yra svarbus veiksnys, išoriniai ištekliai ir parama yra būtini.

	abstract = {An ageing population is a universal phenomenon experienced worldwide. In parallel with these demographic changes, a significant breakthrough in digital devices has also influenced this digital age. Designing instructional strategies to promote meaningful learning among older adult learners has been a long-standing challenge. To enhance older adults’ life-long learning experiences, implementing instructional strategies in the process through which such adults learn can help to improve effective learning. Despite significant calls for research in this area, there is still insufficient research that systematically reviews the existing literature on older adult learning needs and preferences. Hence, in the present article, a systematic literature review was conducted of the effectiveness of instructional strategies designed for older adult learners through the use of digital technologies. The review was guided by the publication standard, which is ROSES (Reporting Standard for Systematic Evidence Syntheses). This study involves articles selected from two established databases, Web of Science and Scopus. Data from the articles were then analysed using the thematic analysis, which resulted in six main themes: (1) collaborative learning; (2) informal learning setting; (3) teaching aids; (4) pertinence; (5) lesson design; and (6) obtaining and providing feedback. The six main themes produced a further 15 sub-themes. The results from this study make significant contributions in the areas of instructional design and gerontology. The findings from this study highlight several important strategies of teaching digital technology, particularly for older adults, as follows: (1) to enhance instructional design use in teaching digital technology based on the needs and preferences of older adult learners; and (2) to highlight the factors for, and impact of, learning digital technologies among older adults.},

	abstract = {Social sustainability is the generation of significant behaviors through balanced levels of education, learning and awareness so that the population has a good standard of living, achieves self-improvement and supports society. This can be achieved with various strategies, one of which is learning through games, which has gained popularity in recent years due to positive results. This is effectively achieved through serious gaming, which is growing steadily, mostly in education and healthcare. This type of strategy has been typically used in young populations with a transparent interaction with technological processes that facilitate its application. However, one cannot neglect other populations such as the elderly, who may experience a technology gap and may not perceive this type of initiative in the best light. The purpose of this article is to identify the different motivations that can encourage older adults to use serious games to encourage learning processes through technology. For this purpose, different previous research on gaming experiences with older adults has been identified, from which it was possible to categorize a series of factors that motivate this population. Subsequently, we represented these factors by means of a model of motivation for the elderly and, to be able to use it, we have defined a set of heuristics based on this model. Finally, we used the heuristics by means of a questionnaire to evaluate the design of serious gaming for older adults, obtaining positive results for the use of these elements to guide the design and construction of serious games for learning in older adults.},

Yet, little research has been done on older adults’ needs and preferences regarding technologies that support physical activity. We address this issue through an exploration of older adults’ exercise motivations grouped around themes relevant to technology design. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 older adults, and followed up with a focus group study of physical trainers and older adults with an active lifestyle. Based on our results, we discuss their conflicting perspectives and challenges on exercise and technology, which leads us to contribute design strategies to support designers as well as researchers wishing to create meaningful and playful fitness applications for older adults.},

	abstract = {Due to social transformation, economic reform, and the advent of an aging society, the number of disadvantaged older adults in China is increasing. The living conditions of the disadvantaged older adult groups determine society’s stability to a certain extent. How to make their lives happier in their old age, promote their subjective well-being, and realize the “enjoyment of the older adults” is of great practical significance in improving social civilization and building a harmonious society.This study uses questionnaires to obtain survey data from the lower counties of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, where there is a high concentration of older learners, and used SPSS 27.0 software to process the data. The results indicated the following: the subjective well-being of disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged older adults differed significantly; learning engagement had a significant effect on enhancing the subjective well-being of disadvantaged older adults, and all dimensions of learning engagement had a significant positive relationship with subjective well-being (SWB). Compared to non-disadvantaged older adults, learning engagement had a more significant contribution to the SWB of disadvantaged older adults.},

Information and communication technologies are nowadays increasingly used for knowledge acquisition, education, cognitive development, etc. Older adults should be prepared to adopt these technologies and take advantage of their capabilities. The purpose of this study was to analyze the cognitive proﬁle of older adults in order to identify the ways that they learn, as well as to analyze older adults’ attitudes, to aid in the development of an e-learning platform adapted to their needs. The sample of the study consisted of 103 older adults, aged 55+, from Greece. According to their responses, older adults seemed to prefer e-learning modules that presented the educational content step-by-step and contained practice questions and examples. In addition, respondents had positive attitudes toward the existence of assessment tests for after the completion of each module. Finally, the utilization of explanatory videos and special graphics in the modules was imperative, according to older adults’ preferences.},

	abstract = {When using electronic devices, older adults usually face challenges associated with difficulties in understanding icons. This study investigated age-related differences in icon identification using various design principles (Experiment 1), as well as the impacts of adding text labels (Experiment 2) and learning strategies (Experiment 3) on improving the performance of older adults. Participants, including older adults (aged 60 or older) and younger individuals, were asked to identify icons matching previous descriptions. The results revealed that the identification performance between older and younger adults varied across icon categories. The addition of text labels resolved differences in icon comprehension related to age of participant and design principles. Learning strategies had diverse effects on the identification performance of older and younger participants, depending on the icon category. These findings provide guidance for designers to apply effective principles and identify optimal strategies to support older adults in the identification and understanding of icons.},

	abstract = {With the popularization of massive open online courses (MOOCs) in the e-learning landscape, more and more older adults are participating in MOOC learning activities. Understanding older adults’ learning motivations in MOOCs will help MOOC developers design suitable learning systems and appropriate course content for older learners. Using a content analysis method, this study identifies six types of learning motivations of older adults in MOOCs: solving problems, acquiring knowledge, improving cognition, seeking fun, benefiting others, and social contact, among which improving cognition is unique to older adults. Based on the above classification, we found that the learning motivations among older adults vary with age and gender. The findings enrich the theories of education for older adults and of learning motivation, and can be used to improve the design of MOOCs for older adults.},
