AB  - In this paper, a new active learning function for system reliability analysis called expected system improvement (ESI) is proposed to predict how updates on component reliability affect system reliability. To measure a change in system reliability, current and updated system reliabilities are estimated when the sign of the updated performance function is positive or negative at an added sample point. The new system active learning function is derived in cases of series, parallel and combined systems, respectively. With the proposed learning function, system reliability analysis iteratively updates a Kriging model by adding the optimal sample point to the design of experiment (DOE) of the critical performance function. An extraction strategy that selects points crucial to both component and system reliabilities is also proposed. Three numerical examples and two real engineering examples were investigated to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed system learning function. The validation results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of the number of function evaluations (NFE) and computational time.

AB  - The method of combining adaptive Kriging surrogate model with fuzzy simulation can efficiently estimate time-dependent failure possibility (TDFP) under fuzzy uncertainty. However, there still exists potential to improve computational efficiency due to the possible conservative issue in current time-dependent U learning function. Thus, based on the stochastic property of Kriging model, a new learning function is proposed by considering the probability of Kriging model misclassifying the time-dependent state of structure. Comparing with the existing time-dependent U learning function, the proposed learning function cannot only select the fuzzy input point whose time-dependent failure state has been correctly recognized by current Kriging model, but also accurately quantify the time-dependent state misclassification probability of the fuzzy input point with unrecognizable time-dependent state. Using the proposed new learning function, the fuzzy input candidate sample, which contributes most to decrease the probability of the Kriging model misjudging the time-dependent state of structure, and the time candidate sample, which possesses most impact to the time-dependent state of the selected fuzzy input sample, can be selected to efficiently guide updating the Kriging model. Then, the efficiency of estimating TDFP is improved. Several case studies are introduced to verify the superiority of the proposed learning function to existing time-dependent U one in view of efficiency.

AB  - An improved adaptive Kriging model-based metamodel importance sampling (IS) reliability analysis method is proposed to increase the efficiency of failure probability calculation. First, the silhouette plot method is introduced to judge the optimal number of clusters for k-means to establish the IS density function, thus avoiding the problem of only assuming clusters arbitrarily. Second, considering the prediction uncertainty of the Kriging model, a novel learning function established from the uncertainty of failure probability is proposed for adaptive Kriging model establishment. The proposed learning function is established based on the variance information of failure probability. The major benefit of the proposed learning function is that the distribution characteristic of the IS density function is considered, thus fully reflecting the impact of the IS function on active learning. Finally, the coefficient of variation (COV) information of failure probability is adopted to define a novel stopping criterion for learning function. The performance of the proposed method is verified through different numerical examples. The findings demonstrate that the refined learning strategy effectively identifies samples with substantial contributions to failure probability, showcasing commendable convergence. Particularly notable is its capacity to significantly reduce function call volumes with heightened accuracy for scenarios featuring variable dimensions below 10.

The learning function is part of the ILC used to stabilize the ILC closed-loop system and determine the convergence rate of the system output.

AB  - In engineering, evaluating the failure probability of structures with complex performance functions is a challenging task. Some active learning methods based on the Kriging model gain considerable attention for structural reliability analysis. The existing learning functions offer new learning criterions to select sample points, but the probability density function (PDF) of sample points is ignored in some learning functions. To decrease selecting sample points in low PDF regions, this study presents a new adaptive weight learning function (WLF). The learning function WLF constituted by the adaptive orient function and the joint PDF can be applicable to multiple learning functions. Depending on the importance degree of candidate sample points, the sample points can be assigned different weight by learning function WLF. When the leaning function WLF is applicated to the existing active learning methods, the sample point with a higher PDF in neighborhood of the limit state function (LSF) can be given a larger weight to preferentially select into design of experiments (DoE). Therefore, the learning function WLF can help the multiple learning functions to select informative sample points with high PDF, which can further improve the efficiency of these learning functions. Four examples are used to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency as well as the suitability of the learning function WLF.

AB  - Reliability analysis is frequently used in structural engineering for the calibration of load and resistance factors, safety assessment of complex systems, and reliability-based optimization of structural systems. Crude Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) provides a complete and strong solution compared to other reliability methods since it can solve multimodal and highly nonlinear problems irrespective of the continuity of the limit state and performance functions. The number of crude MCS trials for reliability analysis can be very high which adversely impacts its efficiency, especially for complex limit state functions. Surrogate models were used with MCS to form an efficient and accurate solution for the reliability analysis. Active learning Kriging (AK) MCS is one of the most robust reliability methods that takes the advantage of surrogate modeling to decrease the cost of calculation while utilizing the accuracy of MCS. The key element in AK-MCS is the learning function which determines the degree of accuracy of the reliability results (the probability of failure and the reliability index) and governs the efficiency of the analysis. This paper investigates the validity and performance of a new learning function for AK-MCS reliability analysis, named KO learning function, using two relevant examples. Analysis results indicated that the KO function is a valid learning function for AK-MCS, and it enhances the performance of AK-MCS compared to other learning functions for the studied examples.

AB  - The classical reliability analysis methods, due to the ever-increasing complexity of engineering structure, may lead to higher and higher calculation errors and costs. The adaptive surrogate-model-based reliability evaluation method strikes a desirable balance between computational efficiency and accuracy, making it a prevalent technique in the domain of reliability evaluation. Learning function is the core of this reliability evaluation method. In this study, a novel learning function is proposed to adaptively choose the best update sample. This learning function does not depend on the prediction variance provided by the Kriging model. Therefore, this learning function is not limited to the Kriging model. In theory, it can be combined with different surrogate models. Four comparative cases are used to illustrate the computational efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method, including series system case with four branches, highly nonlinear two-dimensional numerical example, and two practical engineering case.This article is part of the theme issue 'Physics-informed machine learning and its structural integrity applications (Part 2)'.

AB  - In order to solve the problems in fatigue reliability analysis of mechanical components, a new learning function based on the Kriging model is proposed. In the process of fatigue reliability analysis, surrogate model is often used to fit the implicit performance function to avoid large numbers of calculations of fatigue crack samples. The existing learning functions ignore the information of probability density function (PDF). To overcome this defect and avoid unnecessary sampling in low PDF regions, a novel learning function takes into account the PDF and the local accuracy of Kriging model. The accuracy of the Kriging model is improved by adding samples step by step, and the new training samples are determined by the proposed learning function. The proposed method is verified by two examples from literatures. The results show that, compared with other surrogate models and learning functions, the proposed method has advantages in efficiency, convergence and accuracy. Finally, the proposed method is employed to calculate the fracture failure probability of cracked structures.

AB  - Adaptively constructing the surrogate model for reliability analysis has been widely studied for the advantage of guaranteeing the estimation accuracy while calling the real performance function as little as possible. A new learning function called Folded Normal based Expected Improvement Function (FNEIF) is proposed to efficiently estimate the failure probability. Firstly, an improvement function is constructed by treating the prediction of surrogate model as folded normal variable, while the expectation function of the folded normal variable is an excellent index for measuring the contribution of a point to improve the surrogate model. Secondly, the expectation of the improvement function is analytically derived to identify the new training sample. Thirdly, a new stopping criterion is established based on the uncertainty magnitude of the prediction. Numerical and engineering application examples are introduced to show the effectiveness of the proposed learning function FNEIF for reliability analysis.

The optimal release time is dependent on several factors such as level of reliability, quality, manpower, cost etc. These factors don't have precise or crisp values and thus require fuzzy techniques to optimize the release time. This paper focuses on finding the optimum release time of the software in fuzzy environment. The SRGM with learning function is used to optimize the release time. Results are illustrated numerically and based on fuzzy optimization model we can easily address the problem of timely release of software and give the optimal time of release.

AB  - Bayesian updating is a powerful tool to reassess and calibrate models and their reliability as new observations emerge, and the Bayesian updating with structural reliability method (BUS) is an efficient approach that reformulates it as a structural reliability problem. However, the efficiency and accuracy of BUS depend on a constant c determined by the maximum of likelihood function. To efficiently complete Bayesian updating with new observations related to implicit performance function, a method that combines adaptive Kriging with Bayesian updating is proposed. The proposed method involves three stages. Firstly, an innovatively advanced expected improvement (AEI) learning function is proposed to train the Kriging model of the likelihood function for estimating c, in which the convergence criterion and the strategy of selecting new training point guarantee the accuracy and efficiency of estimating c. Secondly, a new learning function based on expectation and variance of contribution uncertainty function (EVCUF) is proposed to adaptively train the Kriging model of the performance function constructed in BUS to extract posterior samples and complete Bayesian updating of model. By simultaneously taking the expectation and variance of the contribution of the candidate sample to improving accuracy of the Kriging model into consideration, the EVCUF learning function ensures the robust and efficient convergence of the Kriging model. Finally, based on the training points of the previous two stages, the traditional U learning function is employed to subsequentially update Kriging model of the performance function for classifying posterior samples and completing Bayesian updating of reliability. Additionally, a reduction strategy of the candidate sample pool is proposed to improve the efficiency of the proposed method. After demonstrating the basic principle and advantage of the proposed method, three examples are introduced to verify the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.

AB  - A significant challenge of surrogate model-based structural reliability analysis (SRA) is to construct an accurate approximated model of the nonlinear limit state function (LSF) with high order and high dimension effectively. As one of the sequential update-strategies of design of experiment (DoE), the active learning method is more attractive in recent years due to greatly reduces the burden of reliability analysis. Although the active learning method based on information entropy learning function H and the line simulation (AK-LS) is a powerful tool of SRA, the computational burden from the iterative algorithm is still large during the learning process. In this research, an improved learning criterion, named the weight information entropy function (WH), is developed to update the DoE of Kriging-based reliability analysis. The WH learning function consists of the information entropy function and an adaptive weight function (W). Locations in the variable space and probability densities of the samples are taken accounted into the WH learning function, which is the most important difference from the H learning function. The samples that are closer to the LSF and has a greater probability density can be preferentially selected into the DoE comparing to others by changing the weight of information entropy during the learning process. The WH learning function can efficiently match the limit state function in an important domain rather than the entire variable space. Consequently, the approximated model of LSF via Kriging interpolation can be constructed more effectively. The new active learning method is developed based on Kriging model, in which WH learning function and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) are employed. Finally, several engineering examples with high non-linearity are analyzed. Results shown that the new method are very efficient when dealing with intractable problems of SRA.

AB  - Since some identical model inputs are contained in the limit state functions of different failure modes in system reliability analysis, these failure modes are correlated in general. However, the correlations of the failure modes are not considered in constructing the Kriging based learning function for system reliability analysis in most of current publications, which may damage the efficiency of system reliability analysis. To overcome this disad-vantage, a novel Kriging based learning function for system reliability analysis is proposed in this paper by considering the correlations of the failure modes. At first, this paper derives the lower and upper bounds of the probability that the Kriging model misjudges the state (safety or failure) of the system with correlated failure modes at each candidate sample. Then, the reduction of the upper bound of misjudging probability is also deduced when adding a given candidate sample to the training set of a certain failure mode. Thereafter, a novel learning strategy is proposed by simultaneously selecting a new training sample and the corresponding updating failure mode to mostly reduce the upper bound of misjudging probability. Finally, several examples are employed to illustrate the performance of the proposed learning function in system reliability analysis.

In order to improve the accuracy of adaptive Kriging meta-model in system reliability analysis, this paper mainly proposes an improved AK-SYS by using a refined U learning function. The improved AK-SYS updates the Kriging meta-model from the most easily identifiable failure mode among the multiple failure modes, and this strategy can avoid identifying the minimum mode or the maximum mode by the initial and the in-process Kriging meta-models and eliminate the corresponding inaccuracy propagating to the final result. By analyzing three case studies, the effectiveness and the accuracy of the proposed refined U learning function are verified.

AB  - It is inevitable that the characteristics of a robot system change inaccurately or cannot be accurately determined during movement and are affected by external disturbances. There are many adaptive control methods, such as the exact linearization method, sliding control, or neural control, to improve the quality of trajectory tracking for a robot's motion system. However, those methods require a great deal of computation to solve the constrained nonlinear optimization problem. This article first presents some techniques for determining the online learning function parameters of an intelligent controller, including two circuits: the inner circuit is an uncertain function component estimator to compensate for the robot's input, and the outer circuit is an iterative learning controller and does not use a mathematical model of the robot with optimal online learning function parameters. The optimal condition is based on the model in the time domain to determine the learning function parameters that change adaptively according to the sum of squared tracking errors of each loop. As for the intelligent online learning function parameters, they closely follow the general model to stabilize the robot system, based on the principle of intelligent estimation of the uncertainty component and total noise. This method is built on Taylor series analysis for the state vector and does not use a mathematical model of the system at all. It allows feedback linearization, as well as intelligent stabilization of the system. This article's content uses a 2-DOF flat robot implemented on MatlabR2022b software to verify the theory. These findings indicate that superior tracking performance is achievable.

AB  - An improved adaptive Kriging model for importance sampling (IS) reliability and reliability global sensitivity analysis is proposed by introducing the IS density function into learning function. Considering the variance information of Kriging prediction, the formula of traditional IS method is extended to the form considering the uncertainty of symbol function. The estimated variance of failure probability caused by the prediction uncertainty of Kriging model is obtained, and the corresponding coefficient of variation (COV) is defined. Based on the standard deviation information of failure probability, a novel learning function considering the characteristic of IS density function is proposed, which are used to minimize the prediction uncertainty of Kriging. The corresponding stopping criterion is defined based on the COV information. In order to increase the likelihood that the selected sample points fall around the limit state boundary, the penalty function method is introduced to improve the learning function. Once the failure probability is obtained, the variable global sensitivity index is calculated through the failed sample set and Bayes theorem. The results show that: By introducing IS density function and penalty function into learning function, the sample points which contribute more to the failure probability can be obtained more effectively in IS method. The proposed method has high accuracy and efficiency compared with traditional Kriging-based IS method.

AB  - Robust design optimization (RDO) is a remarkable technique for improving product quality in an uncertain environment. The double-loop structure of RDO involves uncertainty quantification which leads to a prohibitive computational issue. Kriging is used to approximate response statistics to decouple the double-loop structure of RDO. Multimodal and highly nonlinear characteristics of response statistics impede the Kriging assisted RDO from obtaining an accurate optimal solution. This paper presents a gradient-assisted (GA) learning function composed of gradient, uncertainty, and distance terms to cope with such issues. The gradient term serves as the key basis for the proposed learning function to reflect the global trend and local optimum. The uncertainty term represents the prediction credibility of candidate samples and the distance term is used to avoid the cluster of training samples. These three terms collaborate in the proposed learning function to identify the updating samples to train the Kriging model of objective function. In order to terminate the training process efficiently, a new stopping criterion based on the gradient direction is proposed. Based on the trained Kriging model, genetic algorithm is utilized to search the robust optimal solution. Three examples were used to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.

AB  - The reliability assessment of structures with multiple failure modes and small failure probability is challenging due to the time-consuming simulations required. Active learning Kriging methods for structural reliability with multiple failure modes have shown high computational efficiency and accuracy. However, selecting the appropriate sample and its failure mode to update the Kriging models remains a key problem. In this paper, we propose a new learning function and stopping criterion to further improve the efficiency of structural system reliability analysis. Firstly, we propose a new learning function that combines the expected improvement function and the U learning function. This function selects the most suitable samples, balancing the degree of expected improvement of samples to the limit state surface and the degree of misclassification probability of samples. Secondly, we propose a new stopping criterion that considers both the accurate construction of limit state surfaces and the probability of accurately predicting the signs of samples. This criterion avoids premature or late termination of the active learning process. Thirdly, the sequential MCS simulation method is employed in the active learning process to efficiently evaluate small failure probability problems. By analyzing four examples, we verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed structural reliability analysis method.

AB  - Scheduling with learning effects has continued to attract the attention of scheduling researchers. However, the majority of the research on this topic has been focused on the single-machine setting. Moreover, under the commonly adopted learning model in scheduling, the actual processing time of a job drops to zero precipitously as the number of jobs increases, which is at odds with reality. To address these issues, we study a two-machine flowshop scheduling problem with a truncated learning function in which the actual processing time of a job is a function of the job's position in a schedule and the learning truncation parameter. The objective is to minimize the makespan. We propose a branch-and-bound and three crossover-based genetic algorithms (GAs) to find the optimal and approximate solutions, respectively, for the problem. We perform extensive computational experiments to evaluate the performance of all the proposed algorithms under different experimental conditions. The results show that the GAs perform quite well in terms of both efficiency and solution quality. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The commonly used reliability analysis approaches for Kriging-based models are usually conducted based on high-fidelity Kriging models. However, high-fidelity surrogate models are commonly costly. Therefore, in order to balance the calculation expense and calculation time of the surrogate model, this paper proposes a multi-fidelity Kriging model reliability analysis approach with coupled optimal important sampling density (OISD+MFK). First, the MEI learning function is proposed considering the training sample distance, model computation cost, expected improvement function, and model relevance. Second, a dynamic stopping condition is proposed that takes into account the failure probability estimation error. Finally, the optimal importance sampling density is incorporated into the reliability analysis process, which can effectively reduce failure probability estimation error. The results of the study show that the approach proposed in this paper can reduce the calculation cost while outputting relatively accurate failure probability evaluation results.

AB  - This study aims to develop a preliminary design of learning function based on the didactical tetrahedron model. The study was a preliminary design phase of design research method. Based on the results of preliminary research, it was found that students had difficulties in solving problems about the function material. One of the serious obstacles in learning function is a reluctance to emphasizes the visual aspect of the concept. Students tend to think the concept of function only in symbolic representation mode. Non-visual approach to learning functions can hinder the development of students to understand function. The notion of didactical tetrahedron in mathematics learning assumes that technology can provide suitable tools to represent mathematics. Dynamic geometry software is an effective and efficient application to help visualize objects mathematics especially in the matter of functions. Dynamic geometry software can provide a visual experience to students in understanding the concepts of functions. The learning design which is prepared with the appropriate learning approach and technology is expected to be able to overcome and anticipate the emergence of learning difficulties and obstacles, so that the objectives of learning mathematics can be achieved properly.

AB  - In structural reliability, an important challenge is to reduce the number of calling the performance function, especially a finite element model in engineering problem which usually involves complex computer codes and requires time-consuming computations. To solve this problem, one of the metamodels, Kriging is then introduced as a surrogate for the original model. Kriging presents interesting characteristics such as exact interpolation and a local index of uncertainty on the prediction which can be used as an active learning method. In this paper, a new learning function based on information entropy is proposed. The new learning criterion can help select the next point effectively and add it to the design of experiments to update the metamodel. Then it is applied in a new method constructed in this paper which combines Kriging and Line Sampling to estimate the reliability of structures in a more efficient way. In the end, several examples including non-linearity, high dimensionality and engineering problems are performed to demonstrate the efficiency of the methods with the proposed learning function.

AB  - In recent years, reliability analysis methods based on the Kriging surrogate model have often been employed to obtain accurate failure probabilities of problems since the Kriging model can be used to provide predictions of the performance function at sample points and the corresponding variance of these predictions. Several learning functions have been explored to update the design of experiments and to complete the iterative process. However, it is still not easy to reduce the number of times the performance function or finite element model (FEM) is called for problems using the Kriging model. In this paper, a new active learning method based on a widely used learning function U is proposed to improve the speed of convergence of the AK-MCS method for problems with a connected domain of failure. Then, three academic examples and one three-unequal-span continuous girder with an implicit performance function are used to verify the accuracy and validity of the AK-MCS method based on the proposed learning method. Comparisons with AK-MCS based on the learning function U and MCS indicate that AK-MCS based on the proposed learning method requires calling the performance function or FEM fewer times than required by AK-MCS based on the learning function U to obtain accurate failure probabilities of the four examples, especially for six-dimensional problems.

AB  - Structural reliability analysis relies on the evaluation of multivariable structural performance function. The construction of the surrogate model for reliability analysis has been widely studied to reduce the number of function calls. The novel learning function has been proposed based on the probability of improvement criterion and the introduction of covariance weight by normalization technique to estimate the failure probability efficiently. Furthermore, the weights of each candidate sample are inconsistent; thus, an improved learning function of the former is proposed by introducing the joint probability density function of the variables. Moreover, a novel adaptive truncated sampling space technique is proposed based on variable normalization transformation. The truncated sampling space is directly dependent on the failure probability rather than the manual definitions. Uniform samples are then obtained in the adaptive truncated sampling space by Latin hypercube sampling. Combined with the novel learning function and global convergence condition, the adaptive analysis of structural reliability is realized. Finally, several highly nonlinear and high-dimensional illustrative applications are used to evaluate and discuss the proposed adaptive learning strategy. Results show that this strategy can efficiently and robustly solve the problem of structural reliability analysis on the premise of ensuring accuracy. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The failure modes of complex systems are often highly dependent. Aiming at the reliability analysis of engineering systems with multiple failure modes, an efficient surrogate model for system reliability with multiple failure modes is proposed, namely, the Copula Adaptive Kriging surrogate model (CAKSM). First, the initial Kriging model is established based on the initial samples. In order to select more effective added samples to update the Kriging model, a new learning function, namely, Copula Unites with Expected Improvement Function (CUEIF), is established. The function can make a reasonable sample selection by considering the failure correlation. Then, based on the optimal Copula function, the reliability data of each failure mode are coupled and analyzed. In order to adapt to various computing scales, regularization is introduced to improve the prediction speed of the surrogate model, and the probability density function of each performance function is obtained by introducing nonparametric kernel density estimation. Finally, the effectiveness of the CAKSM method and the learning function CUEIF is verified through four examples.

AB  - Surrogate-models have proven to be an effective strategy for structural systems with expensive-to-evaluate simulations and are very useful for structural reliability analysis. Many kriging model based adaptive sequential sampling methods have been developed recently for efficient reliability analysis. In this paper, a new learning function based on cross-validation is proposed as the guideline to adaptively select new training points at each iteration for reliability analysis. The epistemic uncertainty of the surrogate models and the effects of the aleatory uncertainty of the random variables are considered simultaneously in the proposed new learning function. Three goals can be achieved using the proposed new learning function, i.e., most of the selected new training sample points (1) are selected from the desired regions to improve computational efficiency; (2) reside around the limit-sate functions and in the regions with high reliability sensitivity; and (3) tend to be far away from existing training points in the current design to avoid the clustering problem. The proposed learning function is partly linked to the probability of failure. The proposed method is easy to code and understand as well as implement. Five numerical examples are finally used to validate the accuracy and efficiency as well as applicability of the proposed method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - PurposeEnsuring the safety of structures is important. However, when a structure possesses both an implicit performance function and an extremely small failure probability, traditional methods struggle to conduct a reliability analysis. Therefore, this paper proposes a reliability analysis method aimed at enhancing the efficiency of rare event analysis, using the widely recognized Relevant Vector Machine (RVM).Design/methodology/approachDrawing from the principles of importance sampling (IS), this paper employs Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) to ascertain the optimal design point. This approach not only guarantees precision but also facilitates the RVM in approximating the limit state surface. When the U learning function, designed for Kriging, is applied to RVM, it results in sample clustering in the design of experiment (DoE). Therefore, this paper proposes a FU learning function, which is more suitable for RVM.FindingsThree numerical examples and two engineering problem demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.Originality/valueBy employing the HHO algorithm, this paper innovatively applies RVM in IS reliability analysis, proposing a novel method termed RVM-HIS. The RVM-HIS demonstrates exceptional computational efficiency, making it eminently suitable for rare events reliability analysis with implicit performance function. Moreover, the computational efficiency of RVM-HIS has been significantly enhanced through the improvement of the U learning function.

AB  - For efficiently analyzing reliability of multimode structure system by adaptive Kriging model combined with Monte Carlo simulation, a new most reduction learning function (MRF) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a contribution function is established to quantify the effect of candidate sample point (CSP) on reducing average probability of misjudging single mode structure state in the differential domain adjacent to CSP. Secondly, the contribution function is explicitly derived after selecting a reasonable size of the differential domain. Thirdly, by the maximum expected contribution function of single mode structure and the logical relationship among modes in multimode structure system, the new learning function named MRF is obtained. The main novelty of this work is proposing a new MRF based strategy for multimode structure system reliability analysis, in which it considers the logical relationship among modes in multimode structure system, probability of misjudging single mode structure state, probability density function and the absolute value of Kriging prediction of single mode structure at CSP. Compared with the up-to-date methods, the proposed strategy for multimode structure system reliability analysis is easier and more efficient to be executed, and its superiority is verified by numerical and engineering examples.

AB  - Reliability analysis evaluates the failure probability of structures considering random variables of a system. Existing methods such as first-order reliability method (FORM) and second-order reliability method (SORM) are difficult to predict the failure probability of implicit functions in mechanical structures. Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) can predict the failure probability with high accuracy, but it is time-consuming. Agent-based methods such as the Kriging model have the approved performance to predict the failure probability in both efficiency and accuracy. An active method is proposed in this paper to improve the efficiency of predicting the probability of failures by combining the Kriging model and MCS, using a new learning function and its stopping condition. A representative selection strategy is developed based on spectral clustering to decide sample points in the design of experiments (DoEs). The new learning function integrates uncertainty and similarity of predicted Kriging values to search the next best sample point for updating the initial DoE. The learning process is terminated based on the stopping condition for a given accuracy of predicted probability of failures. Four case studies are conducted to validate the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method can predict the probability of failures with improved accuracy and reduced time.

AB  - The Kriging-based reliability analysis is extensively adopted in engineering structural reliability analysis for its capacity to achieve accurate failure probability estimation with high efficiency. Generally, the Kriging-based reliability analysis is an active-learning process that mainly includes three aspects: (1) the determination of the design space; (2) the rule of choosing new samples, i.e., the learning function; and (3) the stopping criterion of the active-learning process. In this work, a new learning function and an error-based stopping criterion are proposed to enhance the efficiency of the active-learning Kriging-based reliability analysis. First, the reliability-based lower confidence bounding (RLCB) function is proposed to select the update points, which can balance the exploration and exploitation through the probability density-based weight. Second, an improved stopping criterion based on the relative error estimation of the failure probability is developed to avoid the pre-mature and late-mature of the active-learning Kriging-based reliability analysis method. Specifically, the samples that have large probabilities to change their safety statuses are identified. The estimated relative error caused by these samples is derived as the stopping criterion. To verify the performance of the proposed RLCB function and the error-based stopping criterion, four examples with different complexities are tested. Results show that the RLCB function is competitive compared with state-of-the-art learning functions, especially for highly non-linear problems. Meanwhile, the new stopping criterion reduces the computational resource of the active-learning process compared with the state-of-the-art stopping criteria.

AB  - To reduce the computational burden for structural reliability analysis involving complex numerical models, many adaptive algorithms based on surrogate models have been developed. Among the various surrogate models, the support vector machine for regression (SVR) which is derived from statistical learning theory has demonstrated superior performance to handle nonlinear problems and to avoid overfitting with excellent generalization. Therefore, to take the advantage of the desirable features of SVR, an Adaptive algorithm based on the Bayesian SVR model (ABSVR) is proposed in this study. In ABSVR, a new learning function is devised for the effective selection of informative sample points following the concept of the penalty function method in optimization. To improve the uniformity of sample points in the design of experiments (DoE), a distance constraint term is added to the learning function. Besides, an adaptive sampling region scheme is employed to filter out samples with weak probability density to further enhance the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, a hybrid stopping criterion based on the error-based stopping criterion using the bootstrap confidence estimation is developed to terminate the active learning process to ensure that the learning algorithm stops at an appropriate stage. The proposed ABSVR is easy to implement since no embedded optimization algorithm nor iso-probabilistic transformation is required. The performance of ABSVR is evaluated using six numerical examples featuring different complexity, and the results demonstrate the superior performance of ABSVR for structural reliability analysis in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

AB  - Computing the posterior probability distribution for a set of query variables by search result is an important task of inferences with a Bayesian network. Starting from real applications, it is also necessary to make inferences when the evidence is not contained in training data. In this paper, we are to augment the learning function to Bayesian network inferences, and extend the classical "search"-based inferences to "search + learning"-based inferences. Based on the support vector machine, we use a class of hyperplanes to construct the hypothesis space. Then we use the method of solving an optimal hyperplane to find a maximum likelihood hypothesis for the value not contained in training data. Further, we give a convergent Gibbs sampling algorithm for approximate probabilistic inference with the presence of maximum likelihood parameters. Preliminary experiments show the feasibility of our proposed methods. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents an adaptive Kriging based method to perform uncertainty quantification (UQ) of the photoelectron sheath and dust levitation on the lunar surface. The objective of this study is to identify the upper and lower bounds of the electric potential and that of dust levitation height, given the intervals of model parameters in the one-dimensional (1D) photoelectron sheath model. To improve the calculation efficiency, we employ the widely used adaptive Kriging method (AKM). A task-oriented learning function and a stopping criterion are developed to train the Kriging model and customize the AKM. Experiment analysis shows that the proposed AKM is both accurate and efficient.

AB  - Extensive studies have been carried out for reliability studies on the basis of the surrogate model, which has the advantage of guaranteeing evaluation accuracy while minimizing the need of calling the real yet complicated performance function. Here, one novel adaptive sampling approach is developed for efficiently estimating the failure probability. First, one innovative active learning function integrating with Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) is derived to update the Kriging model by selecting the most suitable sampling point. For improving the efficient property, one trust-region method receives the development for reducing computational burden about the evaluation of active learning function without compromising the accuracy. Furthermore, a termination criterion based on uncertainty function is introduced to achieve better robustness in different situations of failure probability. The developed approach shows two main merits: the newly selected sampling points approach to the area of limit state boundary, and these sampling points have large discreteness. Finally, three case analyses receive the conduction for demonstrating the developed approach's feasibility and performance. Compared with Monte Carlo simulation or other active learning functions, the developed approach has advantages in terms of efficiency, convergence, and accurate when dealing with complex problems.

AB  - Adaptive Kriging surrogate modeling has been widely used in reliability analysis, of which the core is the adaptive learning process. However, for the adaptive learning process, there are two limitations in previous studies: on the one hand, there is no standard about how to select an appropriate learning function among multiple ones developed; on the other hand, the learning function can only pick one updating point per learning cycle, but the parallel computing strategy, which can speed up the computation significantly, has not been fully utilized. Therefore, this paper develops a novel Kriging-based reliability analysis method which can realize online adaptive selection of different learning functions from a variety of well-developed learning functions with a generalized parallel infilling strategy. First, the proposed method takes advantage of the Portfolio allocation strategy invented for the multi-armed bandit problem to pick up an appropriate learning function in each learning iteration, in which the learning function to be selected is determined online according to a reward function considering their previous performance on the closeness to the limit state. Then, a generalized parallel infilling strategy based on an artificial correlation-based influence function is utilized for different learning functions to obtain a desired number of candidate points in one refining cycle without updating the surrogate Kriging model. Finally, five cases, including an engineering application to a large spaceborn deployable antenna, are studied to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - In current years, the metamodel-based reliability analysis method has been developed to assess the failure probability for engineering problems involving time-consuming computational model. Despite the fact that some sequential metamodel-based reliability analysis methods have improved the computational efficiency, there still exists a certain possibility to further reduce the computational effort without loss of accuracy. In this study, an active weight learning method based upon the Kriging model is well proposed for reliability analysis. An active weight learning function based on the optimization theory is built to replace the traditional learning function, in which the important degrees of sampling points on the limit state function are assigned as different weight indices. The Kriging surrogate model is updated according to the proposed active weight learning function. In addition, the proposed strategy is extended to solve the system reliability problem, which can effectively avoid the nonlinearity of composite function in the traditional approach. A novel stopping criterion is also exploited to guarantee the convergence of the proposed method. Five numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and convergence strategy. Results indicate that the proposed method can significantly improve the computational efficiency of reliability analysis without sacrificing computational accuracy.

AB  - Multifidelity (MF) surrogate models have recently attracted intensive attention due to their advantage of reducing computational demand by fusing multiple sources of data. However, their applications in reliability analyses with active learning processes are scarce because of lack of effective strategies for determining locations and fidelities of updated samples. To circumvent this bottleneck, a new active learning-based MF kriging method for reliability analysis via RU learning function and "BSC-Believer" fidelity selection strategy is proposed. The proposed approach employs a two-phase operation to determine location and fidelity of the updated sample in each iteration. In the first stage, the location of the updated sample is ascertained via learning function RU, which has excellent performance regarding the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. Then, the "BSC-Believer" strategy is introduced by combining the estimated relative error of the failure probability, the kriging believer concept, and a cost function to select the optimal fidelity for updating. Through the "BSC-Believer" strategy, the appropriate fidelity for reducing failure probability prediction uncertainty within a unit of computational demand is identified. It is demonstrated through five examples that the proposed algorithm is superior to the recently reported approaches in reducing the computational burden of maintaining the desired estimation accuracy.

AB  - In this study, a combination of Kriging surrogate method with U-learning function and K-means clustering were used to predict the concrete fracture energy (as an output parameter) based on previous experimental data sets including compressive strength, maximum aggregate size and the water to cement ratio (as the input parameters). Therefore a collection of 246 data series obtained from previous studies was collected. The strength, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed models were examined by selecting 10%, 30%, and 50% of the data for learning, and the results were compared with the previous equations. The results show that combining the Kriging method with the U-learning function in the work of fracture method (WFM) will increase the predictive power of fracture energy compared to basic Kriging and K-means clustering methods, and the previous relationships. However, the size effect method (SEM), the models created using K-means and 50% of the data has led to better forecasting results than other models. The value of the correlation coefficient (R-2) of the proposed Kriging combination models and previous existing relationships are in the range of 0.59-0.95 and 0.14-0.69, respectively. The results show that the combination of the Kriging method, the U-learning function, and K-means clustering will reduce the time and cost of the experiments, as well as increasing the accuracy of concrete fracture energy prediction results using a small number of previous experimental data.

A learning stopping condition is proposed, which ensures the prediction accuracy of sample point symbols and significantly reduces the number of learning times. Finally, the numerical minimization problem and the artillery coordinator are taken as examples to verify the correctness of the proposed method.

AB  - The reliability analysis of complex structures usually involves implicit performance function and expensive-toevaluate computational models, which pose a great challenge for the estimation of failure probability. In this paper, an adaptive Kriging-based method is proposed for the efficient estimation of failure probability with high accuracy. Starting from a small set of initial design of experiments (DoE), a Kriging model is constructed and iteratively refined by adding judiciously selected sample points to the DoE. To effectively select more sample points for updating the Kriging model, a new learning function is proposed for the selection of representative samples following the idea of the penalty function method in optimization. Besides, the inclusion of the term that measures the distance between the candidate samples and those in DoE controls the density of samples, and thus enables efficient exploration of the regions of interest. To improve the efficiency of the algorithm, this learning function is integrated with a sampling region scheme to filter out sample points in regions with rather low probability density from the candidate sampling pool. Moreover, a convergence criterion based on the error-based stopping criterion is developed to terminate the learning process at an appropriate stage. Hence, the proposed method is referred to as the Adaptive Kriging method combining Sampling region scheme and Error-based stopping criterion (AKSE). To further explore the possible schemes for the improvement of the proposed method, the combinations of AKSE with a dynamic Kriging method and the bootstrap variance are also investigated. For rare failure events, the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) in AKSE is replaced by the importance sampling (IS) to establish an improved version of AKSE, namely the AKSE-IS. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through five numerical examples and the results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method both in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

AB  - The main task of structural reliability analysis is to estimate failure probability of a studied structure taking randomness of input variables into account. To consider structural behavior practically, numerical models become more and more complicated and time-consuming, which increases the difficulty of reliability analysis. Therefore, sequential strategies of design of experiment (DoE) are raised. In this research, a new learning function, named least improvement function (LIF), is proposed to update DoE of Kriging based reliability analysis method. LIF values how much the accuracy of estimated failure probability will be improved if adding a given point into DoE. It takes both statistical information provided by the Kriging model and the joint probability density function of input variables into account, which is the most important difference from the existing learning functions. Maximum point of LIF is approximately determined with Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) simulation. A new reliability analysis method is developed based on the Kriging model, in which LIF, MCMC and Monte Carlo(MC) simulation are employed. Three examples are analyzed. Results show that LIF and the new method proposed in this research are very efficient when dealing with nonlinear performance function, small probability, complicated limit state and engineering problems with high dimension.

AB  - In this paper, an active learning framework for structural baseline model exploration is proposed based on the Kriging method. The framework is built to solve the problem that when the traditional Kriging approach needs to calibrate more structural parameters, the performance of Kriging predictors hinges very much upon the number of samples obtained from the finite element analysis. A novel information entropy-probability learning function is derived based on Bayesian inference and information entropy. To give a full picture, the uncertainties of different responses should also be quantified during the updating process. Then the effects of uncertainties are considered in both the learning function and objective function constructed from the posterior probabilities. The proposed algorithm is first verified experimentally by a two-span continuous beam considering different types of responses. The framework is then further improved for updating the baseline model of a cable-stayed bridge using field data. The active learning approach, as compared to the ordinary Kriging method, can achieve good performance without undue computational cost and the need for imposing weights on different responses. The proposed baseline model exploration method can be extensively applied to bridge engineering because it facilitates the calibration of numerical models using field measurements and response simulation of extreme loading with significant improvement in computational efficiency and performance of Kriging predictors.

AB  - Strongly nonlinear structural systems exhibit high computational errors when dependability is calculated using conventional approaches such as the primary second-order method of moments and the secondary second-order method of moments. The combination of the proxy model and Monte Carlo simulation is an effective method to solve the structural failure probability problem. However, existing studies on the active learning methods of proxy models for reliability calculation mainly focus on the kriging model, while for radial basis interpolation, the existing research results are relatively few. Based on the above analysis, this paper proposes to combine the cross-validation method with multiple kernel functions to evaluate the uncertainty at the prediction points. The mathematical expression of the active learning function considering three factors is proposed: the linear combination of the distance from the surface of limit state and the uncertainty of the predicted value of the proxy model as the optimization objective function, and the distance between the sample to be selected and the initial sample point as the constraint condition. Meanwhile, using the idea of the penalty function, the constrained problem is transformed into the unconstrained problem to get the final active learning function PLF. Finally, the efficiency, accuracy, and robustness of the PRBFM method are verified by classical cases and compared with other methods. It provides a new method and a new idea for the reliability analysis of complex structures.

AB  - In engineering practices, it is a time-consuming procedure to estimate the small failure probability of highly nonlinear and dimensional limit state functions and Kriging-based methods are more effective representatives. However, it is an important challenge to construct the candidate importance sample pool for Kriging-based small failure probability analysis methods with multiple input random variables when the Metropolis-Hastings (M -H) algorithm with acceptancerejection sampling principle is employed. To address the challenge and estimate the reliability of structures in a more efficient and accurate way, an active learning Kriging model based on the Gibbs importance sampling algorithm (AK-Gibbs) is proposed, especially for the small failure probabilities with nonlinear and high-dimensional limit state functions. A new active learning function that can be directly linked to the global error is first constructed. Weighting coefficients of the joint probability density function in the new active learning function are then determined to select the most probable points (MPPs) and update samples efficiently and accurately. The Gibbs importance sampling algorithm is derived based on the Gibbs algorithm to effectively establish the candidate importance sample pool. An improved global error-based stopping criterion is finally constructed to avoid pre-mature or late -mature for the estimation of small failure probabilities with complicated failure domains. Two numerical and four engineering examples are respectively employed to elaborate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - This paper adopts importance directional sampling (IDS) and adaptive Kriging model for reliability and global sensitivity analysis. IDS is the combination of importance sampling (IS) and directional sampling (DS) by establishing directional vector in the importance region, which has the advantages of both IS and DS. A novel stopping criterion which tries to minimize the difference between the real failure region and fitted failure region is proposed based on the idea of auxiliary region to increase the efficiency of active learning. An improved active learning strategy is proposed based on the combination of optimization and learning function to synchronize the calculation process of design point and Kriging model updating, so as to ensure the accuracy of both Kriging model and importance directional density function. Different learning functions are adopted to select the most suitable active learning function of IDS. The global sensitivity index is calculated through failure probability and Bayes theorem based on Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The results show that: Through the proposed auxiliary region-based stopping criterion, the efficiency of active learning in IDS can be improved. The proposed active learning strategy can obtain high accuracy importance directional density function and failure probability with lower required function calls. Considering the accuracy and robustness of failure probability and global sensitivity index, U and EFF functions should be adopted on IDS.

The system model is provided tools for lecturers and learners to enhanced features for collaboration and interaction among participants in a web-based virtual classroom. The web-based virtual classroom system model is defined by combination of both asynchronous and synchronous learning functions. The asynchronous learning function consists of contents, upload and download documents, webboard, e-mail and video on demand (VoD).

The results show that lecturers and learners are participated in a web-based virtual classroom. A proposed model is better support for personal participation and cognitive participation. This model can improve the convenience and flexibility of scheduling and learning time.

AB  - In sampling-based reliability analysis, a constraint with multiple failure points may lead to an inefficient iteration process and inaccurate results. To examine this problem, a novel analysis method is proposed in this article, which achieves multiple failure point-based constraint model construction. In the proposed method, a radial sampling-based subregion partition method is presented to locate the potential failure subregions that may have a failure point and to construct a subregion partition model to find the model refinement points in parallel. In addition, a new machine learning algorithm, the dendrite network, is adopted to construct the constraint model and the subregion partition model, and a network-matched learning function is designed to assist dendrite network-based model refinement. Test results demonstrate that the number of training samples is decreased compared with other citation methods.

AB  - Structural reliability analysis is typically evaluated based on a multivariate function that describes underlying failure mechanisms of a structural system. It is necessary for a surrogate model to mimic the true performance function as the brute-force Monte-Carlo simulation is computationally intensive for rare failure probabilities. To this end, the paper presents an effective active-learning based Kriging method for structural reliability analysis. The reliability-based expected improvement function (REIF) is first derived based on the folded-normal distribution. To account for the modulating effect of the joint probability density function of input random variables on the scattering geometry of candidate samples, an improvement of the REIF active-learning function, i.e., the REIF2 is further presented. Then, the low-discrepancy samples and adaptively truncated sampling regions are combined together to initiate efficient active-learning iterations. The truncated sampling region is directly related to a structural failure probability result, rather than subjectively fixed by an analyst. Numerical validity of the proposed active-learning functions in conjunction with adaptively truncated sampling region and low-discrepancy samples is demonstrated by several structural reliability examples in the literature.

AB  - To achieve an optimal design of complicated structures with stochastic parameters, the reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) usually needs to handle the nested double optimization loops, which results in unbearable computational cost. In this paper, a new active learning method for RBDO combining with Kriging metamodel and accelerated chaotic single loop approach (AK-ACSLA) is developed, in which the most probable learning function (MPLF) is proposed to search the most probable point instead of the limit state function in entire design space with an active learning behavior. To ensure the high efficiency, the system's most probable learning function (SMPLF) is further constructed to solve the RBDO problem of series system with multiple probabilistic constraints, and then the ACSLA is proposed by taking full advantage of chaos feedback control methodology for guaranteeing the validity of AK-ACSLA. Nonlinear mathematical examples and complex RBDO engineering examples illustrate the high efficiency and accuracy of AK-ACSLA through comparison with both existing gradient-based methods and active learning methods.

AB  - The failure credibility can be used to measure the safety level of the structure under the fuzzy inputs, but the computational efficiency for estimating the failure credibility is still a challenge. A novel method by combining the adaptive Kriging with fuzzy simulation (AK-FS) is proposed to efficiently estimate the failure credibility. The proposed method firstly employs the FS to transform the estimation of failure credibility into a classification problem, which can be viewed as a bi-level strategy. In the inner loop, a Kriging model for the actual complicated performance function is actively trained by U-learning function in the sample pool generated by FS until the convergent condition is satisfied, on which the samples are divided into failure group and safety group by the well-trained Kriging model instead of the actual performance function in the outer loop. Finally, the failure credibility is obtained by respectively searching the maximum joint membership degrees of the samples in these two groups. The proposed AK-FS method only evaluates the actual performance function in the process for constructing the Kriging model. Since the U-learning function can iteratively construct a sufficiently accurate Kriging model with model evaluations as little as possible, thus the failure credibility can be efficiently and accurately estimated by the proposed AK-FS method. The advantages of the proposed AK-FS method are demonstrated by several examples. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reliability Analysis (RA) is a critical aspect of structural design and performance evaluation aiming to determine the probability of structural failure under given random input parameters. With modern development of modeling techniques, computational models have achieved higher fidelity but at the increased cost of computational time, which poses a significant challenge for RA. Consequently, surrogate model-assisted RA has been explored as a means of improved efficiency and accuracy. This study proposes a novel learning function, Samplebased Expected Uncertainty Reduction (SEUR), for surrogate model-assisted RA. The SEUR function uses statistical information from the metamodeling with fixed hyper-parameters to construct expected failure probability bounds to sequentially update the design of experiment (DoE). The joint probability densities of input variables are accounted for through simulation methods, including Monte Carlo (MC) and subset simulation (SS). Furthermore, the discrete simulated annealing algorithm is used to search for the optimal design point. The performance of proposed AK-SEUR function is systematically evaluated using six examples of different dimensions, failure probability levels and nonlinearities. The AK-SEUR function is demonstrated to be more effective and efficient than other popular active learning methods in dealing with nonlinear performance functions, small probabilities, and complex limit states. The proposed SEUR function has the potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of RA, particularly in situations where computational models are time-consuming and the search for the optimal solution is challenging.

In this article, a novel and efficient technique for predicting wind velocity is discussed. Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of the Michaelstadt wind tunnel experiment and the Tel Aviv center are used to supervise a machine learning function. Using the machine learning function it is possible to observe wind flow patterns in the form of eddies and spirals emerging from street canyons. The flow patterns observed in urban canopies tend to be predominantly localized, as the machine learning algorithms utilized for flow prediction are based on local morphological features.

AB  - When the reliability analysis of the mechanical products with high nonlinearity and time-consuming response is carried out, there will be the problems of low precision and huge computation using the traditional reliability methods. To solve these issues, the active learning reliability methods have been paid much attention in recent years. It is the key to choose an efficient learning function (such as U, EFF, and ERF). The aim of this study is to further decrease the computation and improve the accuracy of the reliability analysis. Inspired from these learning functions, a new point-selected learning function (called HPF) is proposed to update DOE, and a new point is sequentially added step by step to the DOE. The proposed learning function can consider the features like the sampling density, the probability to be wrongly predicted, and the local and global uncertainty close to the limit state. Based on the stochastic property of the Kriging model, the analytic expression of HPF is deduced by averaging a hybrid indicator throughout the real space. The efficiency of the proposed method is validated by two explicit examples. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the mechanical reliability analysis (involving time-consuming and nonlinear response). By comparing with traditional mechanical reliability methods, the results show that the proposed method can solve the problems of large computation and low precision.

AB  - Scheduling with learning effects has received a lot of research attention lately. However, the flowshop setting is relatively unexplored. On the other hand, the actual processing time of a job under an uncontrolled learning effect will drop to zero precipitously as the number of jobs increases. This is rather absurd in reality. Motivated by these observations, we consider a two-machine flowshop scheduling problem in which the actual processing time of a job in a schedule is a function of the job's position in the schedule and a control parameter of the learning function. The objective is to minimize the total completion time. We develop a branch-and-bound and three simulated annealing algorithms to solve the problem. Computational results show that the proposed algorithms are efficient in producing near-optimal solutions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Line Sampling (LS) has been widely recognized as one of the most appealing stochastic simulation algorithms for rare event analysis, but when applying it to many real-world engineering problems, improvement of the algorithm with higher efficiency is still required. This paper aims to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of LS by active learning and Gaussian process regression (GPR). A new learning function is devised for informing the accuracy of the calculation of the intersection points between each line associated with LS and the failure surface. Then, an adaptive algorithm, with the learning function as an engine and a stopping criterion, is developed for adaptively training a GPR model to accurately estimate the intersection points for all lines in LS scheme, and the number of lines is actively increased if it is necessary for improving the accuracy of failure probability estimation. By introducing this adaptive GPR model, the number of required function calls has been largely reduced, and the accuracy for estimation of the intersection points has been largely improved, especially for highly nonlinear problems with extremely rare events. Numerical test examples and engineering applications show the superiority of the developed algorithm over the classical LS algorithm and some other active learning schemes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In recent years, the active learning reliability method that combines the Kriging model and Monte Carlo simulation (AK-MCS) has emerged as a promising approach due to its computational efficiency and accuracy. However, the commonly used learning functions, such as the expected feasibility function (EFF), U function, H function, and expected risk function (ERF), can only select one training point at each iteration which is timewasteful when parallel computing is available. Therefore, this paper proposes a parallel active learning Kriging strategy, namely P-AK-MCS, for structural reliability analysis. By introducing an influence function that reflects the impact of the added point on the original learning function, four parallel learning functions are constructed: pseudo-U (PU) function, pseudo-EFF (PEFF), pseudo-H (PH) function, and pseudo-ERF (PERF). These functions aim to identify multiple training points at each iteration without requiring additional functional evaluations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using four examples. The results demonstrate that compared to the standard AK-MCS, the proposed P-AK-MCS significantly reduces the number of computation loops and greatly decreases computational costs. Moreover, the total number of functional evaluations required is similar to that of the standard AK-MCS and remains insensitive to the number of multiple training points.

AB  - This paper proposes an active learning Kriging (ALK) based reliability analysis method for a multi-output structural system by using a multiple response Gaussian process (MRGP) model. Firstly, various failure modes, including their interactions, are involved in a multi-output structural system. The MRGP model is used to construct the surrogate model directly because it can efficiently characterize the correlation between different failure modes. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is integrated into the MRGP model to optimize the hyperparameter. Secondly, similar to ALK-based reliability method, three improved functions for these common learning functions (e.g., U-function, EFF-function, H-function) are proposed, which consider the distance requirement between the iteration sample point and training samples. Finally, the cross-validation methodology is employed as the stopping criterion and several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness.

AB  - The prevalence of highly nonlinear and implicit performance functions in structural reliability analysis has increased the computational effort significantly. To solve this problem, an efficiently active learning function, named parameter adaptive expected feasibility function (PAEFF) is proposed using the prediction variance and joint probability density. The PAEFF function first uses the harmonic mean of prediction variances of Kriging model to judge the iteration degree of the current surrogate model, to realize the scaling of the variance in the expected feasibility function. Second, to improve the prediction accuracy of the Kriging model, the joint probability densities are applied to ensure that the sample points to be updated have a higher probability of occurrence. Finally, a new failure probability-based stopping criterion with wider applicability is proposed. Theoretically, the stopping criterion proposed is applicable to all active learning functions. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed PAEFF are verified by two mathematical calculations and three engineering examples.

AB  - Collecting enough samples is difficult in real applications. Several interval-based non-probabilistic reliability methods have been reported. The key of these methods is to estimate system non-probabilistic reliability index. In this paper, a new method is proposed to calculate system non-probabilistic reliability index. Kriging model is used to replace time-consuming simulations, and the efficient global optimization is used to determine the new training samples. A refinement learning function is proposed to determine the best component (or performance function) during the iterative process. The proposed refinement learning function has considered two important factors: (1) the contributions of components to system non-probabilistic reliability index, and (2) the accuracy of the Kriging model at current iteration. Two stopping criteria are given to terminate the algorithm. The system non-probabilistic index is finally calculated based on the Kriging model and Monte Carlo simulation. Two numerical examples are given to show the applicability of the proposed method.

AB  - This paper proposes an efficient Kriging-assisted improved cross-entropy (ICE) method for random-interval hybrid reliability analysis. This method employs Kriging to substitute for the projection outlines of limit state surface and incrementally updates the Kriging model within the final layer samples of ICE. A novel learning function that combines both the lower and upper confidence bounds for extremum searching is proposed to identify samples on the projection outlines. Additionally, an error-based stopping criterion (EBSC) is proposed to avoid unnecessary updates to the Kriging model. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated through four benchmark examples. Furthermore, the method is applied to two practical engineering scenarios: the strength reliability analysis of a bogie and the resonance reliability analysis of an axially functionally graded material (FGM) pipeline. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves high levels of efficiency and accuracy.

AB  - This article describes a new adaptive Kriging method combined with adaptive importance sampling approximating the optimal auxiliary by iteratively building a Gaussian mixture distribution. The aim is to iteratively reduce both the modeling and sampling errors simultaneously, thus avoiding limitations in cases of very rare failure events. At each iteration, a near optimal auxiliary Gaussian distribution is defined and new samples are drawn from it following the scheme of adaptive multiple importance sampling (MIS). The corresponding estimator is provided as well as its variance. A new learning function is developed as a generalization of the U learning function for MIS populations. A stopping criterion is proposed based on both the modeling error and the variance of the estimator. Results on benchmark problems show that the method exhibits very good performances on both efficiency and accuracy.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE TWENTY-EIGHTH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
CP  - 28th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence
AB  - Attributed network embedding plays an important role in transferring network data into compact vectors for effective network analysis. Existing attributed network embedding models are designed either in continuous Euclidean spaces which introduce data redundancy or in binary coding spaces which incur significant loss of representation accuracy. To this end, we present a new Low-Bit Quantization for Attributed Network Representation Learning model (LQANR for short) that can learn compact node representations with low bitwidth values while preserving high representation accuracy. Specifically, we formulate a new representation learning function based on matrix factorization that can jointly learn the low-bit node representations and the layer aggregation weights under the low-bit quantization constraint. Because the new learning function falls into the category of mixed integer optimization, we propose an efficient mixed-integer based alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm as the solution. Experiments on real-world node classification and link prediction tasks validate the promising results of the proposed LQANR model.

AB  - This paper studies the dynamics implied by the Chamley (1993) model, a variant of the two-sector model with an implicit characterization of the learning function. We first show that under some "regularity" conditions regarding the learning function, the model has (a) one steady state, (b) no steady states or (c) two steady states (one saddle and one non-saddle). Moreover, via the Bogdanov-Takens theorem, we prove that for critical regions of the parameters space, the dynamics undergoes a particular global phenomenon, namely the homoclinic bifurcation. Because these findings imply the existence of a continuum of equilibrium trajectories, all departing from the same initial value of the predetermined variable, the model exhibits global indeterminacy.

AB  - Kriging has gained significant attention for reliability analysis primarily because of the analytical form of its uncertainty information, which facilitates adaptive training and establishing stopping criteria for the training process. Learning functions play a significant role in both selection of training points and stoppage of the training. For these functions, most existing learning functions evaluate candidate training points individually. However, lack of consideration for the global effects can lead to suboptimal training. In addition, the subjectivity of these stopping criteria may result in over or undertraining of surrogate models. To overcome these gaps, we propose Global Error-based Learning Function (GELF) for optimal refinement of Kriging surrogate models for the specific purpose of reliability analysis. Instead of prioritizing training points based on their uncertainty and proximity to the limit state like the existing learning functions, GELF for the first time directly and analytically associates the maximum error in the failure probability estimate to the global effect of choosing a candidate training point. This development subsequently facilitates an adaptive training scheme that minimizes the error in adaptive reliability estimation to the highest degree. For this purpose, GELF uses hypothetical future uncertainty information by treating the current construction of the surrogate model as a generative model. The proposed method is tested on three classic benchmark problems and one practical engineering problem. Results indicate that the proposed method has significantly better computational efficiency than the state-of-the-art methods while achieving high accuracy in all the numerical examples.

AB  - For more and more complicated engineering structures, it is a challenge to efficiently estimate the profust failure probability based on the probability inputs and fuzzy state assumption. By combining active learning Kriging with Monte Carlo simulation (AK-MCS), an efficient method is proposed to estimate the profust failure probability. Firstly, the profust failure probability is transformed into an integral of the classical failure probability by introducing a variable related to the fuzzy state assumption. This integral is further reorganized as a weighted sum of a series of classical failure probabilities by Gaussian quadrature, and the series of the classical failure probabilities have the similar limit state function constructions constrained by different thresholds. Secondly, MCS is used according to the probability input distribution to generate the sample pool, in which the active learning Kriging is used to establish the surrogates of the series of similar limit state functions with different thresholds. An improved learning function is proposed by minimizing the U-learning function minima corresponding to all limit state functions, so that the candidate with the largest effect on the surrogating quality of all limit states can be selected as a training point to update the Kriging model. Once the updating process of the Kriging model converges, all limit state functions can be identified by the Kriging model, and the profust failure probability can be estimated by using the Kriging model without any extra model evaluation. Several examples are used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed strategy for estimating the profust failure probability. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - For the structural reliability analysis, although many methods have been proposed, they still suffer from substantial computational cost or slow convergence rate for complex structures, the limit state function of which are highly non-linear, high dimensional, or implicit. A novel adaptive surrogate model method is proposed by combining support vector machine (SVM) and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) to improve the computational efficiency of estimating structural failure probability in this paper. In the proposed method, a new adaptive learning method is established based on the kernel function of the SVM, and a new stop criterion is constructed by measuring the relative position between sample points and the margin of SVM. Then, MCS is employed to estimate failure probability based on the convergent SVM model instead of the actual limit state function. Due to the introduction of adaptive learning function, the effectiveness of the proposed method is significantly higher than those that employed random training set to construct the SVM model only once. Compared with the existing adaptive SVM combined with MCS, the proposed method avoids information loss caused by inconsistent distance scales and the normalization of the learning function, and the proposed convergence criterion is also more concise than that employed in the existing method. The examples in the paper show that the proposed method is more efficient and has broader applicability than other similar surrogate methods.

AB  - A large effort is devoted to the research of new computing paradigms associated with innovative nanotechnologies that should complement and/or propose alternative solutions to the classical Von Neumann/CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) association. Among various propositions, spiking neural network (SNN) seems a valid candidate. i) In terms of functions, SNN using relative spike timing for information coding are deemed to be the most effective at taking inspiration from the brain to allow fast and efficient processing of information for complex tasks in recognition or classification. ii) In terms of technology, SNN may be able to benefit the most from nanodevices because SNN architectures are intrinsically tolerant to defective devices and performance variability. Here, spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), a basic and primordial learning function in the brain, is demonstrated with a new class of synapstor (synapse-transistor), called nanoparticle organic memory field-effect transistor (NOMFET). This learning function is obtained with a simple hybrid material made of the self-assembly of gold nanoparticles and organic semiconductor thin films. Beyond mimicking biological synapses, it is also demonstrated how the shape of the applied spikes can tailor the STDP learning function. Moreover, the experiments and modeling show that this synapstor is a memristive device. Finally, these synapstors are successfully coupled with a CMOS platform emulating the pre- and postsynaptic neurons, and a behavioral macromodel is developed on usual device simulator.

AB  - This paper first proposes a modeling framework to study diffusion of innovations which exhibit strong interaction with the institution systems across which they diffuse. A unique character of such generic innovation is that specific applications are continually developed during its diffusion. This self-propagation in continual applications generation, which is dependent upon the cumulative installed base of the technological innovation, can be modeled to lead to a dynamic changing carrying capacity in an otherwise simple logistic diffusion curve. The cumulative installed base is dependent upon the price of technology and the cost learning dynamics. This paper utilizes a multi-factors learning function to represent such learning dynamics. Empirical estimates from our model are compared with those from other logistics curve formulations and are shown to better fit the annual PV production data during the past quarter century in the case of Japan.
   The very fact that the potential of this class of innovation can be leveraged only if it interacts closely with the institution highlights the importance of institutional determinants of adoption and diffusion of such innovations like PV. We therefore attempt to put forward an institutional framework, based on viewing PV as a technology platform, to consider PV diffusion beyond mathematical and empirical modeling. Some future research directions are also proposed. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The reliability analysis methods based on the Kriging model have been explored to update the design of experiments (DoE), but the number of calls to the performance function is high. In this paper, a new active learning method combining the weight information entropy function (WH) and the adaptive candidate sample pool is proposed to improve the reliability analysis efficiency. Based on the information entropy function (H), the learning function WH is constructed to consider Kriging variance and the joint probability density function (PDF). In this proposed method, the sample points can be assigned different weight by the learning function WH according to the important degrees of sample points. The point which not only nears the limit state function (LSF), but also has a high probability density function value and large Kriging variance is assigned more weight than others. To select the sample points with lower confidence level, the adaptive candidate sample pool is generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. The Kriging model can be updated efficiently by the proposed method. Four numerical examples and an engineering example with implicit performance function are used to verify the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the computational efficiency of the reliability analysis without losing accuracy.

Previous methods only focus on in-domain supervised learning which is limited by the rare annotated data. However, there are enough corpora in formal domains and massive in-domain unannotated texts which can be used to improve the task. We propose a unified model which can learn from out-of-domain corpora and in-domain unannotated texts. The unified model contains two major functions. One is for cross-domain learning and another for semi-supervised learning. Cross-domain learning function can learn out-of-domain information based on domain similarity. Semi-Supervised learning function can learn in-domain unannotated information by self-training. Both learning functions outperform existing methods for NER in Chinese social media. Finally, our unified model yields nearly 11% absolute improvement over previously published results.

AB  - This work addresses the issue of model selection in adaptive kriging-based Monte Carlo reliability analysis. It is shown that arbitrary model selection (kriging trend and correlation) can lead to poor probability of failure estimates for complex systems. We propose a method for kriging model development that employs information-theoretic multimodel inference and introduces an averaged kriging model derived from the associated model probabilities. The proposed multimodel kriging model is then integrated into an adaptive sample selection method that merges the surrogate enhanced stochastic search method with a learning function modified from the adaptive kriging-Monte Carlo simulation (AK-MCS) method. The result is an efficient method for a surrogate model-based reliability analysis that converges as fast as, or faster than, the AK-MCS method but with significantly improved robustness providing greater assurance in model accuracy.

AB  - This paper addresses a two-machine no-wait flowshop problem with the effect of the truncated learning function of jobs whose actual processing times depend on their positions in the sequence. By considering truncated learning effect, the actual processing time of a job is a function of its position index in the schedule and a control parameter. In a production scenario with truncated learning effect, the actual processing time of a job will not be lower than a threshold when the number of processed jobs increases. We develop a branch and bound algorithm to minimize the makespan. A lower bound and a dominance property have been proposed to increase the speed of elimination process in the branch and bound algorithm.

AB  - There are many requirements fur predicting traveling times on express ways. It is difficult to predict traveling time with high precision when traffic flows change dynamically, such as at the beginning and end of traffic jams. It is therefore important to develop a traffic simulation model using time-series data using traffic counters. The model must cope with secular changes of traffic-flow characteristics such US construction of new expressways or environment condition changes. This paper proposes a new travel time prediction system which has a model learning function using time-series data processing. The new system is a mixed structure type neural network based travel time prediction system. It has a modeling function and a model learning function using field data processing on a time series basis. The proposed system has already been tested on an actual expressway, and satisfactory results were achieved.

AB  - This study examines a two-stage three-machine flow-shop assembly scheduling model in which job processing time is considered as a mixed function of a controlled truncation parameter with a sum-of-processing-times-based learning effect. However, the truncation function is very limited in the two-stage flow-shop assembly scheduling settings. To overcome this limitation, this study investigates a two-stage three-machine flow-shop assembly problem with a truncation learning function where the makespan criterion (completion of the last job) is minimized. Given that the proposed model is NP hard, dominance rules, lemmas and a lower bound are derived and applied to the branch-and-bound method. A dynamic differential evolution algorithm, a hybrid greedy iterated algorithm and a genetic algorithm are also proposed for searching approximate solutions. Results obtained from test experiments validate the performance of all the proposed algorithms.

AB  - In this study, an adaptive relevant vector machine, which is developed within a probabilistic Bayesian learning framework, is combined with Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) to perform reliability analysis with high efficiency and accuracy. A new active learning function is proposed that comprehensively considers the probability of mis-predictions and spatial locations of the existing sampling points to search for the best next point to enrich the training samples. To avoid redundant original model evaluations, an efficient stopping criterion is adopted to terminate the active learning process in a timely manner. The proposed method is tested with five examples involving non-differentiability, high nonlinearity, and practical engineering problems. The proposed method can obtain highly accurate failure probability predictions with a small number of evaluations of the original model in comparison with the direct MCS and other methods in the literature. In conclusion, the proposed method is recommended for structural reliability analyses in engineering practice. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the field of the system reliability analysis with multiple failure modes, the advances mainly involve only random uncertainty. The upper bound of the system failure probability with multiple failure modes is usually employed to quantify the safety level under Random and Interval Hybrid Uncertainty (RI-HU). At present, there is a lack of an efficient and accurate method for estimating the upper bound of the system failure probability. This paper proposed an efficient Kriging model based on numerical simulation algorithm to solve the system reliability analysis under RI-HU. This method proposes a system learning function to train the system Kriging models of the system limit state surface. The convergent Kriging models are used to replace the limit state functions of the system multi-mode for identifying the state of the random sample. The proposed system learning function can adaptively select the failure mode contributing most to the system failure probability from the system and update its Kriging model. Thus, the efficiency of the Kriging training process can be improved by avoiding updating the Kriging models contributing less to estimating the system failure probability. The presented examples illustrate the superiority of the proposed method.(c) 2021 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Assessing the failure probability of complex aeronautical structure is a difficult task in presence of uncertainties. In this paper, active learning polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is developed for reliability analysis. The proposed method firstly assigns a Gaussian Process (GP) prior to the model response, and the covariance function of this GP is defined by the inner product of PCE basis function. Then, we show that a PCE model can be derived by the posterior mean of the GP, and the posterior variance is obtained to measure the local prediction error as Kriging model. Also, the expectation of the prediction variance is derived to measure the overall accuracy of the obtained PCE model. Then, a learning function, named expected indicator function prediction error (EIFPE), is proposed to update the design of experiment of PCE model for reliability analysis. This learning function is developed under the framework of the variance-bias decomposition. It selects new points sequentially by maximizing the EIFPE that considers both the variance and bias information, and it provides a dynamic balance between global exploration and local exploitation. Finally, several test functions and engineering applications are investigated, and the results are compared with the widely used Kriging model combined with U and expected feasibility function learning function. Results show that the proposed method is efficient and accurate for complex engineering applications.

AB  - Uncertainty of quantitative models of input variables and computational model could certainly cause the uncertainties of structural response and structural reliability. Hence, structural reliability analysis requires precise input uncertainty model and highly accurate solving model. However, not all uncertain input variable can be described by an explicit quantitative model in practical engineering. Generally, only incomplete samples of some variables are available in practice. Though Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) has been used to solve above problem, we are confronted with another trouble due to the expensive two-layer MCSs. Furthermore, approximate methods for reliability assessment would cause confidence problem of reliability. To handle with the challenges, an adaptive kriging (AK) model-based approach is proposed by dividing the two-layer MCSs into two AK models. Simultaneously, a new quantitative model for interval variables is developed to deal with input uncertainty. And a novel learning function improved by H learning function (IH function) is developed with a weight function to enhance the efficiency of constructing kriging models. The IH function not only considers design sites with large uncertainty, but also actively searches for that around the LSF by assigning different weight value for design points. In the proposed approach, the first AK model is constructed for reliability prediction. And the relationship between parameters of input models and reliability is built by the other kriging model using the first one. Credibility assessment will be implemented according to the second model. Since, only the first AK model needs the time-consuming finite element (FE) calculations, the proposed approach could significantly improve the efficiency of confidential reliability analysis without losing accuracy. Several numerical examples are implemented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model.

CP  - 19th Brazilian Symposium on Artificial Intelligence
AB  - Spiking neural networks - networks that encode information in the timing of spikes - are arising as a new approach in the artificial neural networks paradigm, emergent from cognitive science. One of these new models is the pulsed neural network with radial basis function, a network able to store information in the axonal propagation delay of neurons. Learning algorithms have been proposed to this model looking for mapping input pulses into output pulses. Recently, a new method was proposed to encode constant data into a temporal sequence of spikes, stimulating deeper studies in order to establish abilities and frontiers of this new approach. However, a well known problem of this kind of network is the high number of free parameters - more that 15 - to be properly configured or tuned in order to allow network convergence. This work presents for the first time a new learning function for this network training that allow the automatic configuration of one of the key network parameters: the synaptic weight decreasing factor.

AB  - Time-variant reliability analysis aims at estimating the probability that an engineering system successfully performs intended missions over a certain period of time under various sources of uncertainty. In order to perform the time-variant reliability analysis efficiently, this paper presents a high dimensional model representation (HDMR) model combined with an active learning strategy to estimate the failure probability of dynamic problem. Firstly, the HDMR meta-model is established in the augmented input space (random variables and time) based on Gaussian process regression technique. Then, a reliability analysis approach incorporating epistemic uncertainty is proposed, and a learning function is introduced to update the experimental design sequentially. Finally, the Monte Carlo simulation method is applied for time-variant failure probability assessment based on the well-developed HDMR meta-model. Two engineering applications are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for time-variant reliability analysis.

AB  - This paper presents a new reinforcement learning algorithm that enables collaborative learning between a robot and a human. The algorithm which is based on the Q(lambda) approach expedites the learning process by taking advantage of human intelligence and expertise. The algorithm denoted as CQ(lambda) provides the robot with self awareness to adaptively switch its collaboration level from autonomous (self performing, the robot decides which actions to take, according to its learning function) to semi-autonomous (a human advisor guides the robot and the robot combines this knowledge into its learning function). This awareness is represented by a self test of its learning performance. The approach of variable autonomy is demonstrated and evaluated using a fixed-arm robot for finding the optimal shaking policy to empty the contents of a plastic bag. A comparison between the CQ(lambda) and the traditional Q(lambda)-reinforcement learning algorithm, resulted in faster convergence for the CQ(lambda) collaborative reinforcement learning algorithm.

AB  - Scheduling with learning effects has received continuing attention in the recent days. However, it can be found that the actual processing time of a given job drops to zero precipitously as the job has a big processing time or the number of jobs increases. Moreover, most researchers paid more attention to single-machine settings, and the flowshop settings then are relatively unexplored. Motivated by these observations, we consider a two-machine total completion time flowshop problem in which the actual job processing time is a function depending on the jobs that have already been processed and a control parameter. In this paper, we develop a branch-and-bound and a genetic heuristic-based algorithm for the problem. In addition, the experimental results of all proposed algorithms are also provided.

AB  - In order to overcome the drawbacks of expensive function evaluation in the practical reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) problem, researchers have proposed the black box-based RBDO method. The algorithm flow of the commonly employed RBDO method for the black box problem consists of the outer construction loop of the surrogate model of the constraint function and the inner surrogate model-based solving loop. To improve the solving ability of the black box RBDO problem, this paper proposes a transformation-based improved kriging method to increase the effectiveness of the two loops identified above. For the outer loop, a sample distribution-based learning function is suggested to improve the construction efficiency of the surrogate model of the constraint function. For the inner loop, a paired incremental sample-based limit reliability boundary construction approach is suggested to transform the RBDO problem into an equivalent deterministic design optimization problem that can be efficiently solved by classical optimization algorithms. The test results of five cases demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately construct the surrogate model of the constraint function and efficiently solve the black box RBDO problem.

AB  - For complex engineering problems, multi-fidelity modeling has been used to achieve efficient reliability analysis by leveraging multiple information sources. However, most methods require nested training samples to capture the correlation between different fidelity data, which may lead to a significant increase in low-fidelity samples. In addition, it is difficult to build accurate surrogate models because current methods do not fully consider the nonlinearity between different fidelity samples. To address these problems, a novel multi-fidelity modeling method with active learning is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a nonlinear autoregressive multi-fidelity Kriging (NAMK) model is used to build a surrogate model. To avoid introducing redundant samples in the process of NAMK model updating, a collective learning function is then developed by a combination of a U-learning function, the correlation between different fidelity samples, and the sampling cost. Furthermore, a residual model is constructed to automatically generate low-fidelity samples when high-fidelity samples are selected. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are demonstrated using three numerical examples and an engineering case.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to propose an efficient method for solving reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) problems. Design/methodology/approach In the proposed algorithm, genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to search the global optimal solution of design parameters satisfying the reliability and deterministic constraints. The Kriging model based on U learning function is used as a classification tool to accurately and efficiently judge whether an individual solution in GA belongs to feasible region. Findings Compared with existing methods, the proposed method has two major advantages. The first one is that the GA is employed to construct the optimization framework, which is helpful to search the global optimum solutions of the RBDO problems. The other one is that the use of Kriging model is helpful to improve the computational efficiency in solving the RBDO problems. Originality/value Since the boundaries are concerned in two Kriging models, the size of the training set for constructing the convergent Kriging model is small, and the corresponding efficiency is high.

AB  - In this paper, a new system reliability-based design optimization (SRBDO) method is proposed for problems where performance function values are obtained from different simulation models. For this purpose, a new active learning function is derived according to the system type by predicting the system reliability increase after the sample point is added to the design of experiment (DOE) of performance functions in each simulation model. In the proposed SRBDO method, a Kriging model is sequentially updated by adding the optimal sample point to the DOE of performance functions included in the critical simulation model, which can be obtained by comparing the proposed active learning function. The accuracy of the Kriging model and SRBDO optimum convergence are utilized as the stop criteria. The proposed method can be applicable to SRBDO problems regardless of system type. Three numerical and two real engineering examples are investigated to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method. The validation results indicate that the proposed method is accurate and efficient in finding the SRBDO optimum under multiple simulation models.

AB  - Even though extensive efforts have been made, structural reliability analysis method with both efficiency and robustness is still infrequent in engineering especially when time-consuming numerical models are involved. To address the issue, this paper develops multi-ring-based important sampling (MRIS) and incorporates it into the Kriging-based reliability analysis method authors previously proposed. MRIS can uniformly fill the region of importance with an acceptable number of random points regardless of the number of most probable points and failure sub-domains of investigated structure. As MRIS does not need to evaluate Kriging model during sampling random points, its efficiency does not decrease with increasing the training points of Kriging model, which is a substantial advantage. Therefore, it is used as an optimization method to search for the best next point so as to adaptively increase the accuracy of Kriging model. Additionally, the failure probability predicted by Kriging model and its corresponding accuracy measure are roughly calculated with MRIS. Both of them are essential to judge whether Kriging model meets with a prescribed requirement. Four benchmark examples verify the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed reliability analysis method.

AB  - It is important to determine the safety lifetime of Multi-mode Time-Dependent Structural System (MTDSS). However, there is still a lack of corresponding analysis methods. Therefore, this paper establishes MTDSS safety lifetime model firstly, and then proposes a Kriging surrogate model based method to estimate safety lifetime. The first step of proposed method is to construct the Kriging model of MTDSS performance function by using extremum learning func-tion. By identifying possible extremum mode of MTDSS, the performance function of MTDSS can be equivalently transformed into the one of Single-mode Time-Dependent Structure (STDS). The second step is to use the Advanced First Failure Instant Learning Function (AFFILF) to train the Kriging model constructed in the first step, so that the convergent Kriging model can identify the possible First Failure Instant (FFI) of STDS. Then safety lifetime can be searched quickly by dichotomy search. By using AFFILF, the minimum instant that the state is not accurately identified by the current Kriging model is selected as the training point, which avoids the unnecessary calcu-lation which may be introduced into the existing First Failure Instant Learning Function (FFILF). In addition, the Candidate Sample Pool (CSP) reduction strategy is also adopted. By adaptively deleting the random candidate sample points whose FFI have been accurately identified by the cur-rent Kriging model, the training efficiency is further improved. Three cases show that the proposed method is accurate and efficient.(c) 2022 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Surrogate models combined with Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) are effective ways to address failure probability problems, which involve time-consuming computer codes, in structural reliability analysis. Recently, many active learning functions based on the Kriging model have been developed to conduct adaptive sequential sampling due to its predicted value and variance. However, effective methods for learning functions based on other surrogate models to address failure probability problems remain sparse. Hence, this paper presents a new adaptive sampling function that combines the radial basis function (RBF) approximate model with MCS to calculate the failure probability of structures. The new learning function is named the active RBF method with multiple kernel functions and Monte Carlo simulation (ARBFM-MCS). It uses several RBF kernel functions to estimate the local uncertainty of the predicted values based on interquartile range (IQR) to formulate the active learning function. This method can establish several surrogate models simultaneously for application to different problems. The stopping criterion of this method is that if one of the errors calculated by the various RBF models meets the demand, the learning process stops automatically. Furthermore, the method is also compared with the k-fold cross-validation approach based on a single RBF kernel function and some other approaches presented in the literature. Six numerical examples are considered to verify the accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed method. The results reveal that the multiple kernel function method is effective and has the same accuracy level as other methods. Moreover, for these examples, the method often calls the limit state function in fewer times to obtain accurate failure probabilities.

AB  - Response surface methods (RSMs) have been developed to improve the efficiency of reliability analysis for computationally time-consuming systems. Most RSMs cannot self-evaluate the accuracy of reliability analysis results and rely on Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) for verification. Therefore, this renders a challenging question in RSM applications that how to determine whether the number of sampling points is sufficient to achieve target accuracy of reliability analysis. Adaptive Kriging MCS (AK-MCS) utilizes the advantage of self-estimated uncertainty in Kriging method and combines a learning function to sequentially select additional sampling points to improve the accuracy of reliability analysis until a target accuracy is achieved. However, extensive sampling data are required to ensure that the trend function and auto-correlation structure function of AK-MCS are reliable, and AK-MCS does not work with high-dimensional or highly non-stationary data. To address these challenges, this study develops an active learning reliability analysis method using adaptive Bayesian compressive sensing (ABCS) and MCS, denoted ABCS-MCS. ABCS-MCS can self-evaluate the uncertainty of predictions and combines a learning function to adaptively determine the minimum number of sampling points and their locations for achieving a target accuracy of reliability analysis. This approach is directly applicable to non-stationary data because BCS is non-parametric and data-driven, and thus does not incorporate a trend function or an auto-correlation function. Investigations using two highly non-stationary analytical functions and a slope reliability analysis problem reveal that ABCS-MCS outperforms AK-MCS.

KW  - Parallel learning
AB  - Time-dependent reliability analysis quantifies the failures of structural systems due to time-dependent uncertainties, such as material degradation and dynamic loads. The active learning Kriging model methods are widely used in structural reliability analysis to replace extensive time-consuming finite element simulations. However, they can only update one training sample and one failure mode per iteration, which limits their application to time-dependent, parallel computing, and multiple failure modes problems. In this study, we propose a new parallel active learning Kriging model for time-dependent reliability analysis, which can update multiple training samples and multiple failure modes per iteration. It includes the following strategies: (1) a novel parallel learning function is proposed, which combines the correlation function and U learning function to allow for the selection of multiple training samples per iteration; (2) an adaptive adjustment strategy for the number of parallel samples is proposed, which takes into account the prediction probability of parallel samples; (3) the proposed parallel learning function is integrated into time-dependent reliability analysis with multiple failure modes, enabling simultaneous updates of multiple training samples and failure modes, thus greatly reducing the number of iterations and computational time; and (4) a new stopping criterion is proposed to improve the efficiency of the estimation of failure probability. The proposed method can be applied to series or parallel time-dependent structural systems with multiple failure modes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through three examples, and the proposed method can achieve a balance between the computational time and function calls while maintaining a high level of accuracy in the estimation of timedependent failure probability.

AB  - For reliability analysis under wide existing random and interval mixed uncertainties (RIMU), the failure probability upper bound (FPUB), a conservative index to quantify the reliability level of the structure, is the basis for structural safety assessment under RIMU. To accurately and efficiently estimate FPUB, this paper proposes a novel importance sampling method based single-loop Kriging model (IS-SLK), in which the IS variance reduction is combined with the SLK of the performance function, and a new most reduction learning function under RIMU (MRLF-RI) is established. By introducing the IS probability density function (PDF), the proposed IS-SLK firstly expresses the FPUB as the product of the approximate FPUB estimated by current SLK and the correction term, then it designs a strategy of two-step adaptive updating SLK to calibrate FPUB. The innovation of the IS-SLK includes two aspects. Firstly, it constructs a quasi optimal IS PDF to approach the optimal one based on adaptively updating SLK, and the simple reject sampling method is employed to extract the sample of IS PDF, on which the required size of candidate sample pool for obtaining the convergent FPUB can be reduced and the robustness of the algorithm is improved. Secondly, based on the comprehensive consideration of multiple factors, which include the misclassification probability of structural state, joint PDF and Kriging prediction at the IS candidate sample, as well as the logical relationship between the states of random input candidate samples and those at different realizations of interval input, the new learning function named as MRLF-RI is established to adaptively select the training sample contributing most to improve the estimation accuracy of FPUB. Moreover, by deriving the upper bound of the expected relative error, a convergence criterion of MRLF-RI is constructed to further improve the efficiency. Compared with the up-to-date methods, the proposed IS-SLK is more efficient, and its superiority is verified by four examples.

AB  - Reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) constitutes a crucial methodology for batch product quality improvement, attracting widespread attention in industrial engineering. The efficiency in calculating the products' performance parameters and the precision in determining the most probable target point (MPTP) are considered two pivotal factors influencing the implementation effects of RBDO. State-of-the-art RBDO methods typically overlook the risks associated with sample aggregation and misclassification of constraint functions, resulting in inefficiency, imprecision, and a pronounced deviation between the optimization scheme and engineering reality. Here, we propose an efficient and multi-fidelity reliability-based design optimization method. Initially, an innovative strategy for locally updating the surrogate model based on a curvature learning function is introduced to address the misclassification of constraint functions and balance the increasing samples' effectiveness and computational accuracy. Subsequently, a novel adaptive MPTP-solving strategy is applied to search for approximate MPTP. Based on this, an efficient and multi-fidelity RBDO framework is formulated, synchronously enhancing the efficiency, precision, and applicability of RBDO. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by applying the proposed method to three numerical examples and a practical engineering instance involving an electromagnetic relay.

AB  - Railway turnout (RT) is a crucial component of railway infrastructure that consists of several components. Assessing the derailment probability of freight wagons passing through the turnout is crucial for quantifying failure risks and optimizing the performance of the freight wagon-turnout system (FWTS). However, existing assessment methods often require extensive model evaluations and impose substantial computational costs. To address this issue, an efficient reliability analysis method is established for assessing the derailment risk at RTs. Firstly, a dynamic model is developed to capture the wheel-rail dynamic interaction and the numerical model is validated by field tests. Secondly, to reduce the computational cost in the reliability analysis, an efficient adaptive Kriging method based on an error stopping criteria and a learning function is adopted to estimate the failure probabilities under multiple failure modes of wheel derailments. Based on the efficient learning function and convergence criterion, accurate failure probability results can be obtained with a small number of multibody and finite element coupled dynamic simulations. Furthermore, the prediction accuracy of the proposed method in capturing random characteristics for FWTS is evaluated. Finally, the influence of the evolution of rail wear on the failure probability is further discussed.

AB  - Metamodel combined with simulation type reliability method is an effective way to determine the probability of failure (P-f) of complex structural systems and reduce the burden of computational models. However, some existing challenges in structural reliability analysis are minimizing the number of calls to the numerical model and reducing the computational time. Most research work considers adaptive methods based on ordinary Kriging with a single point enrichment of the experimental design (ED). This paper presents an active learning reliability method using a hybrid metamodel with multiple point enrichment of ED for structural reliability analysis. The hybrid method (termed as APCKKm-MCS) takes advantage of the global prediction and local interpolation capability of Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) and Kriging, respectively. The U learning function drives active learning in this approach, while K-means clustering is proposed for multiple point enrichment purposes. Two benchmark functions and two practical marine structural cases validate the performance and efficiency of the method. The results confirm that the APCKKm-MCS approach is efficient and reduces the computational time for reliability analysis of complex structures with nonlinearity, high dimension input random variables, or implicit limit state function.

AB  - This paper proposes an effective active learning strategy for reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) problems in which the constraint functions are acquired from multiple simulation models. To achieve this goal, a new active learning function (ALF) is derived by estimating the increased reliability of active constraint functions after adding one point to the train points of constraint functions in each simulation model. The proposed ALF distinguishes possibly active constraint functions that seem active near the current optimum and considers how the constraint functions are active. In the proposed RBDO method, a Kriging model is iteratively updated by adding the best point to the train points of constraint functions included in the crucial simulation model until the optimum converges and the Kriging model is sufficiently accurate. The best point and the crucial simulation model are obtained by comparing the proposed ALF. The ALF is further modified to apply to problems where the cost of each simulation model is different. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, two numerical and one engineering examples are analyzed. The results show that the proposed method efficiently and accurately obtains the RBDO optimum involving multiple simulation models, regardless of simulation cost.

AB  - Existing ensemble-learning methods for reliability analysis are usually developed by combining ensemble learning with a learning function. A commonly used strategy is to construct the initial training set and the test set in advance. The training set is used to train the initial ensemble model, while the test set is adopted to allocate weight factors and check the convergence criterion. Reliability analysis focuses more on the local prediction accuracy near the limit state surface than the global prediction accuracy in the entire space. However, samples in the initial training set and the test set are generally randomly generated, which will result in the learning function failing to find the real ???best??? update samples and the allocation of weight factors may be suboptimal or even unreasonable. These two points have a detrimental impact on the overall performance of the ensemble model. Thus, we propose a general hierarchical ensemble-learning framework (ELF) for reliability analysis, which consists of two-layer models and three different phases. A novel method called CESM-ELF is proposed by embedding the classical ensemble of surrogate models (CESM) in the proposed ELF. Four examples are investigated to show that CESM-ELF outperforms CESM in prediction accuracy and is more efficient in some cases.

AB  - There have been many applications of two-stage three-machine assembly flow shop in query scheduling, such as fire engine assembly, personal computer manufacturing, and distributed database system. Moreover, learning phenomenon has been shown present in many two-stage assembly flow shop environments. In conjunction with this learning phenomenon, we addressed, in this study, a two-stage three-machine flow shop scheduling problem with a cumulated learning function. Our objective was to search an optimal sequence for minimizing the flowtime (or total completion time). We developed some dominance propositions with a lower bound used in a branch-andbound algorithm for small-size jobs. We also proposed six versions of hybrid particle swam optimization (PSO) algorithms to find approximate solutions for small-size and big-size jobs, and for three different data types. In addition, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to examine the performances of the six PSOs for each data type. Subsequently, Fisher's least significant difference tests were carried out to further make pairwise comparisons among the performances of the six algorithms.

AB  - Estimating the small failure probability of highly reliable structures is often computationally expensive in reliability analysis. The adaptive kriging-based reliability analysis methods have been widely used to solve this issue. However, the kriging refinement phase of these methods may not achieve adequate efficiency due to a large candidate sample pool (CSP) size and unnecessary limit state function (LSF) evaluations. In this work, an efficient adaptive kriging refinement method (EAKRM) is proposed to alleviate the computational burden. First, a CSP generation strategy is developed using the radius sequence to gradually generate uniform samples along the direction vector until the failure region appears. Considering points with a high risk of misjudgment and located outside of CSP, a two-stage training point selection strategy is then proposed based on the learning function U to determine the most valuable training point. Finally, a correlation-based stopping criterion is presented by quantifying the consistency of the kriging predictive signs between two successive refinement processes. Three mathematical examples and three engineering examples are employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed EAKRM.

AB  - Random uncertainty and evidence uncertainty usually coexist in actual structures. For efficient reliability analysis of structure in presence of hybrid random and evidence uncertainties (RA-HRE), a single-layer sampling method (SLSM) is proposed. First, two equivalent expectation formulas are derived for the belief and the plausibility measures in RA-HRE. According to these formulas, the belief and the plausibility measures can be directly estimated by only one group of samples of the random variables and focal elements of the evidence variables that are generated at the same level. Second, for greatly reducing the computational cost in RA-HRE by SLSM, the SLSM-based bi-objective adaptive kriging (SLSM-BAK) is subsequently developed to simultaneously estimate the belief and the plausibility measures. Aiming at the two objectives in RA-HRE, that is, accurately estimating the belief and the plausibility measures, a new compound learning function is developed in SLSM-BAK. Based on the compound learning function, the kriging model is adaptively updated to accurately and efficiently recognize the sign of the maximum and minimum performance functions for each random sample over the corresponding sampled focal element. This training process continues until both the estimation precision of the belief and the plausibility measures satisfy the preset requirements.

AB  - Active-learning Kriging (AK) was developed as a surrogate-aided reliability technique to address the need for efficient reliability estimation when assessing complex limit states. The results of AK analyses are sensitive to the choice of the regression function, correlation function, learning function and associated stopping criteria, and reliability estimation technique, with unique sets of these input parameters referred to as AK configurations. For the reliable use of AK analysis in bridge reliability assessment, recommendations regarding the best-performing AK configurations are needed to balance the desired accuracy-to-efficiency of the simulation. The objective of this study was to recommend sets of AK configurations for the reliability analysis of reinforced-concrete bridge girders and piers that can be readily used by engineers to perform AK analysis for bridge design optimization and assessment. An extensive parametric analysis, using 432 unique AK configurations and over 3,000 AK analyses, was performed, combined with the application of a comprehensive metric system to recommend the top five best-performing AK configurations for bridge analysis based on the root mean square error, the absolute average error, the degree of consistency, and total number of training points.

AB  - For uncertain structures with the coexisting random and interval inputs, effectively estimating the lower and upper bounds of failure probability is always a challenge. To address this issue, this paper first proposes a two-stage adaptive radial-based importance sampling (TARBIS) method, where two optimal spheres are sought successively in two stages to estimate the bounds of failure probability. Then, by replacing the true limit state function using the Kriging model, a Kriging-assisted TARBIS (K-TARBIS) is further developed to improve the computational efficiency. In the first stage, the training points mostly contributing to the estimation of two bounds of failure probability are identified by a system reliability theory-based U (SYSU) learning function to update the Kriging model. In the second stage, the Kriging model is updated only on sample points contributing to the estimation of the upper bound of failure probability. Throughout the active learning process, the Kriging model is sequentially updated in a series of small sub-candidate sample pools of TARBIS, which greatly reduces the computational cost. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated through four representative examples.

AB  - This paper develops a new adaptive surrogate model method for structural reliability analysis, which is constructed by approximating the limit state function (LSF) using stochastic configuration network (SCN) ensemble model. The proposed ensemble model integrates three SCN base models and sets weights for each prediction result, reducing outliers and greatly improving the output accuracy and stability of the algorithm. In constructing a surrogate model for reliability analysis, a new adaptive sampling strategy is designed, including a novel learning function. The new strategy enables the most informative sample points are selected and significantly reduce the number of required sample point. Without further calls to the LSF, the structural failure probability is quickly evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation in terms of the constructed SCN ensemble surrogate model. Three benchmark problems, including a highly nonlinear problem with small failure probability and two multivariable engineering structural problems, are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Reliability analysis for structural systems with multiple failure modes and expensive-to-evaluate simulations is challenging. In this paper, a new and efficient system reliability method is proposed based on the adaptive importance sampling and kriging models. The Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm is used to construct several Markov chains to fully explore complex failure regions. A number of Markov chain states are selected as the center of the component importance sampling functions to generate samples for reliability analysis. Based on the component importance sampling function of each selected chain state, the system importance sampling function is constructed with the weighting index. The system importance sampling function can be constructed effectively because it does not involve time-consuming simulations and the most probable point (MPP) search. The new learning function, which is directly linked to the system failure probability, is developed to adaptively select the best added samples for refining the kriging models at each iteration. The adaptive importance sampling method and kriging models are well-combined for system reliability analysis in the proposed method. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method, generally, offers the following advantages: (1) The learning function and stopping criterion are directly linked to system failure probability; (2)the adaptive importance sampling and kriging models are well-combined to yield accurate results based on a small sample size for small failure probability problems; (3) the weights of sampling centers are considered, and the MPP search is not required at each iteration; (4) it is applicable for complex systems regardless of the structure and system failure probability level. Three numerical examples are analyzed, which demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for complex system reliability analysis. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - With increasing complexity of engineering problems, various traditional reliability analysis methods are facing rising challenges in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy. Surrogate models, especially Kriging model, have received growing attention and been widely used in reliability analyses by the virtue of their advantages for achieving high computational efficiency and ensuring high numerical accuracy. Nevertheless, there have been still two significant problems in the Kriging model-assisted reliability analyses due to the absence of prior knowledge: i.e. (1) the size of candidate sample pool tends to be quite large in order to ensure prediction of a convergent failure probability; and (2) local prediction accuracy of limiting state surface by Kriging model is generally excessive. These above two issues can often result in high computational cost for Kriging-based reliability analyses. To enhance computational efficiency, a new method that combines adaptive Kriging and n-hypersphere rings, named an AK-HRn method, is proposed in this study. First, the n-hypersphere rings, which can update its position and radius adaptively, is adopted to divide the design space into potential safety domains and potential failure domains. Second, these potential failure domains are used as the sampling domains for implementing importance sampling method to generate a suitably-sized candidate sample pool. Third, a novel learning function is presented to enrich the design of experiment (DoE), which avoids excessive local prediction accuracy of Kriging models by establishing the rejection domains. Finally, the efficiency and robustness of AK-HRn is compared with other Kriging-based reliability analysis methods through four illustrative numerical examples and one 6-DOF industrial robot case study. Comparison shows that the proposed AK-HRn method has high efficiency and robustness to solve complex reliability analysis problems.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the field of reliability engineering, the active learning reliability method that amalgamates Kriging model and Monte Carlo simulation has been devised and proven to be efficacious in reliability analysis. Nevertheless, the performance of this method is sensitive to the magnitude of candidate sample pool, particularly for systems with small failure probabilities. To surmount these limitations, this paper proposes an active learning method that obviates the need for candidate sample pools. The proposed method comprises two stages: construction of surrogate model and Monte Carlo simulation for failure probability estimation. During the surrogate model construction stage, the surrogate model is iteratively refined based on the representative samples selected by solving the optimization problem facilitated by the particle swarm optimization algorithm. To achieve an optimal balance between solution accuracy and efficiency, the penalty intensity control and the density control for the experimental design points are incorporated to modify the objective function in optimization. The per-formance of the proposed method is evaluated using numerical examples, and results indicate that by leveraging an optimization algorithm to select representative samples, the proposed method overcomes the limitations of traditional active learning methods based on candidate sample pool and exhibits exceptional performance in addressing small failure probabilities.

AB  - A critical problem in engineering reliability analysis is obtaining an accurate failure probability with a high computational efficiency. This study aims to present failure probability estimation under the conditions of uncertain input variables and their uncertain distribution parameters. An adaptive Kriging model of failure probability with respect to distribution parameters (FP-DP model) is developed, which avoids coupling modeling among the distribution parameters, input variables, and failure probability. An improved U-learning function that simultaneously considers the statistical information of uncertain distribution parameters and failure probability is proposed to select new sampling points for the FP-DP model. The stopping criteria based on sample distances and relative errors of the predicted failure probability are constructed to improve the convergence performance around the limit state function. Three numerical and four engineering examples with different complexities are considered to verify the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive FP-DP Kriging metamodel. The results show that the proposed method can obtain an accurate failure probability with fewer sampling points of uncertain distribution parameters than some existing methods, indicating that the proposed method can be efficiently integrated into reliability-based design optimization problems considering both the uncertainties of input variables and their distribution parameters.

AB  - An important challenge in structural reliability is to reduce the number of calls to evaluate the performance function, especially the complex implicit performance functions. To reduce the computational burden and improve the reliability analysis efficiency, a new active learning method is developed to consider the probability density function of samples based on the learning function U in an active learning reliability method that combines the kriging and Monte Carlo simulation. In the proposed method, the proposed active learning function contains two parts: part A is based on function U, and part B is based on the probability density function and function U. By changing the weights of parts A and B, the sample points close the limit-state function, and those in the region with a higher probability density function have more weight to be selected compared to the others. Subsequently, the kriging model can be constructed more effectively. The proposed method avoids a large number of time-consuming function evaluations, and the recommended weight is also reported. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through three numerical examples and one engineering example. The results demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.

AB  - Reliability analysis aims to estimate the exceedance probability of structural response over a prescribed threshold value, which is essentially a multi-dimensional integral problem. In this paper, a novel and efficient reliability analysis method combining Laplace asymptotic integral and artificial neural network is proposed. Laplace asymptotic integral is employed to approximate the multi-dimensional integral to calculate the failure probability, and an active artificial neural network is taken as the surrogate model. Different from the existing surrogate model-based reliability methods, the proposed method focuses on approximating the limit state function in the vicinity of the target design point, instead of that in the whole sample space. No candidate sample population for active learning is needed, which significantly reduces the requirement for computer memory and improves the calculation efficiency. A novel learning function based on an optimization formulation is proposed in this paper to select the most informative samples for local approximation. Some numerical examples as well as a practical engineering issue are studied, and the superiority of the proposed method over other surrogate model-based reliability analysis methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy are verified.

AB  - Reliability analysis is time consuming, and high efficiency could be maintained through the integration of the Kriging method and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). This Kriging-based MCS reduces the computational cost by building a surrogate model to replace the original limit-state function through MCS. The objective of this research is to further improve the efficiency of reliability analysis with a new strategy for building the surrogate model. The major approach used in this research is to refine (update) the surrogate model by accounting for the full information available from the Kriging method. The existing Kriging-based MCS uses only partial information. Higher efficiency is achieved by the following strategies: (1) a new formulation defined by the expectation of the probability of failure at all the MCS sample points, (2) the use of a new learning function to choose training points (TPs). The learning function accounts for dependencies between Kriging predictions at all the MCS samples, thereby resulting in more effective TPs, and (3) the employment of a new convergence criterion. The new method is suitable for highly nonlinear limit-state functions for which the traditional first-and second-order reliability methods (FORM and SORM) are not accurate. Its performance is compared with that of existing Kriging-based MCS method through five examples.

AB  - In structural reliability analysis, the development of an efficient and versatile active learning method applicable to problems of varying complexities remains a challenging task. The critical contribution of this work is the elegant implementation of the Kriging-based importance sampling and dimension reduction techniques within an active learning framework. Specifically, the proposed algorithm employs a dimension reduction technique that considers the contributions of important and unimportant random variables, enabling it to handle high-dimensional problems effectively. To exploit the merits of the adaptive Kriging method, a quasi-optimal importance sampling density is established based on the predictive information provided by the Kriging model. Additionally, a novel learning function allocation (LFA) strategy is proposed to automatically select the appropriate learning function from a portfolio of options. This facilitates the selection of new samples near the limit state surface with significant contributions to the failure probability. Moreover, an efficient stopping criterion is introduced to terminate the active learning process at an appropriate stage effectively. In other words, the proposed method inherits the merits of Adaptive Kriging, Dimension Reduction, and Importance Sampling, hence named AK-DRIS in this study. The overall performance of AK-DRIS is verified through several numerical examples of different complexities.

AB  - The active learning surrogate model based on adaptive sampling strategy is increasingly popular in reliability analysis. However, most of the existing sampling strategies adopt the trial and error method to determine the size of the Monte Carlo (MC) candidate sample pool which satisfies the requirement of variation coefficient of failure probability. It will lead to a reduction in the calculation efficiency of reliability analysis. To avoid this defect, a new method for determining the optimal size of the MC candidate sample pool is proposed, and a new structural reliability analysis method combining polynomial chaos based Kriging model (PC-Kriging) with adaptive sampling region is also proposed (PCK-ASR). Firstly, based on the lower limit of the confidence interval, a new method for estimating the optimal size of the MC candidate sample pool is proposed. Secondly, based on the upper limit of the confidence interval, an adaptive sampling region strategy similar to the radial centralized sampling method is developed. Then, the k-means++ clustering technique and the learning function LIF are used to complete the adaptive design of experiments (DoE). Finally, the effectiveness and accuracy of the PCK-ASR method are verified by three numerical examples and one practical engineering example.

AB  - With the ever-increasing complexity of engineering problems, active learning functions fused with Kriging models are receiving significant attention and are extensively applied in various reliability analysis methods. It is argued unfavorably that the existing fusion-type methods usually obtain only a single optimal sample point during model updating process. Meanwhile, the information of the used sample points is not sufficiently utilized. To these gaps, this study proposes an adaptive Kriging reliability analysis method based on an approximate parallel computing strategy, namely AP-AK for short. To start with, a new Kriging model update strategy is proposed, where the first selected sample points help to introduce the intermediate model and further search for optimal points closer to the limit state surface. An improved learning function is then proposed to limit the locations of points based on the information of used sample points. The new function is characterized by setting the acceptance and rejection domains of the sample points, which prevents computational waste incurred by local sample point aggregation. Superior performance of the AP-AK method is demonstrated against other Kriging-based methods through five numerical cases and one solid attitude orbit control engine case. The comparison results show that the proposed method exhibits high efficiency and robustness for solving complex reliability analysis problems.

AB  - This paper presents a novel multiple-surrogate method to compute the probability of failure. Recently, some adaptive methods using Kriging surrogate model have been developed for structural reliability assessment. However, a suitable regression trend in the Kriging model is so important to reduce the number of calls to performance function by adaptive Kriging method. Hence, this paper develops the original adaptive Kriging method to use different regression trends. The proposed method is based on a machine-learning algorithm, namely "query by committee", in which adaptive training samples are selected based on the maximal disagreement between multiple surrogate models. The proposed method has a low sensitivity to the type of regression trends, because the algorithm starts with different regression trends, and inappropriate regression trends are filtered out in the next iterations. Therefore, the use of multiple surrogates can provide an efficient tool to estimate the probability of failure. In addition, two new approaches of prediction with multiple surrogates are employed in the proposed method. These approaches are based on the local and global surrogate models that provided by the learning function. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through three analytical and two structural problems. The results show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This paper is devoted to the probabilistic stability analysis of a tunnel face excavated in a two-layer soil. The interface of the soil layers is assumed to be positioned above the tunnel roof. In the framework of limit analysis, a rotational failure mechanism is adopted to describe the face failure considering different shear strength parameters in the two layers. The surrogate Kriging model is introduced to replace the actual performance function to perform a Monte Carlo simulation. An active learning function is used to train the Kriging model which can ensure an efficient tunnel face failure probability prediction without loss of accuracy. The deterministic stability analysis is given to validate the proposed tunnel face failure model. Subsequently, the number of initial sampling points, the correlation coefficient, the distribution type and the coefficient of variability of random variables are discussed to show their influences on the failure probability. The proposed approach is an advisable alternative for the tunnel face stability assessment and can provide guidance for tunnel design.

AB  - Introducing surrogate models in time-dependent reliability analysis is an effective means to reduce the computational burden, but improving the efficiency of reliability analysis is still a challenge. In this paper, an effective single loop Kriging surrogate method combing stratified sampling for structural time-dependent reliability analysis is developed to improve the computational efficiency of time-dependent reliability. First, by dividing the candidate samples into four regions, reliability analysis is performed by sequential sampling in each region. In addition, the candidate samples for each analysis are smaller than the initial set of generated original samples, which can improve the computational efficiency of time-dependent reliability. Second, in order to select the candidate samples that contribute much to the reliability analysis, a new learning function is proposed that can consider the misclassification probability and probability density of the candidate samples. Finally, in order to further accelerate the convergence of the algorithm, a combined convergence criterion is proposed that is able to consider the relative error of failure probability, coefficient of variation, and convergence state. The accuracy and effectiveness of the method are demonstrated by four examples.

AB  - In recent years, technology developments are more rapidly. How to learn and obtain desired knowledge efficiently has become an important but complicated problem. We hope that there are methods can give us some suggestions about how to learn knowledge efficiently. In this paper, we introduced some learning behavior of people, and then use our designed Effective Learning Curve Model to imitate this learning phenomenon. Using our learning function model, we can imitate people's learning behavior through pretesting. Every one has different learning behavior functions on learning distinct courses. Different learning sequence of courses will cause different learning efficiency. From this view, we proposed Max Learning Efficiency Slope First Algorithm (MLESFA) by differential learning functions to give people some suggestions about courses learning sequence and obtain desired knowledge efficiently. These algorithms also can help us to understand how much time we have to spend on each course in order to get better learning efficiency under time limitation. Finally, we make some learning example and compare simulation results with other courses learning algorithms. From the simulation results, we can see that our MLESFA algorithm has better learning efficiency than others.

AB  - Time-dependent system reliability analysis still faces severe challenges including the simultaneous consideration of time-dependent uncertainties under multiple failure modes and the accurate estimation of small failure probability. Therefore, this paper proposes a nested single-loop Kriging (NSLK) model coupled with subset simulation (SS) method, named NSLK-co-SS, for time-dependent system reliability assessment. Firstly, based on the rationale of SS method, the small time-dependent system failure probability is converted into the product of a series of large intermediate failure probabilities by introducing a series of intermediate failure events. Then, by reformulating the time-dependent system reliability problem as a nested system reliability one, the NSLK method is developed to estimate each intermediate failure probability. Meanwhile, a system reliability theory-based U (SYSU) learning function is proposed to identify both the best training sample and mode and sequentially update the Kriging models of multiple modes in a series of small intermediate sample pools. Two numerical examples and an engineering example were investigated to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.

AB  - We propose two novel heuristic search techniques to address the problem of scheduling tasks under hard timing constraints on a single processor architecture. The underlying problem is NP-hard in the strong sense and it is a fundamental challenge in feedback-control theory and automated cybernetics. The proposed techniques are a learning-based approaches and they take much less memory space. A partial feasible schedule is maintained and extended over a repeated problem solving trials, previously assigned priorities are refined according to the gained information about the problem to lead the convergence to a complete feasible schedule if one exists. First, we present the learning in hard-real-time with single learning (LHRTS-SL) algorithm where a single learning function is utilized, then we discuss its drawback and we propose the LHRTS with double learning algorithm in which a second learning function is integrated to cope up with LHRTS-SL drawback. Experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed techniques in terms of success ratio when used to schedule randomly generated problem instances.

AB  - Structural reliability analysis has an inherent contradiction between efficiency and accuracy. The metamodel can significantly reduce the computational cost of reliability analysis by a simpler approximation. Therefore, it is crucial to build a metamodel, which achieves the minimum simulations and accurate estimation for reliability analysis. Aiming at this, an effective adaptive metamodel based on the combination of radial basis function (RBF) model and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is proposed. Different shape parameters are first used to generate the weighted prediction variance, and the search for new training samples is guided by the active learning function that achieves a tradeoff of (1) being close enough to limit state function (LSF) to have a high reliability sensitivity; (2) keeping enough distance between the existing samples to avoid a clustering problem; and (3) being in the sensitive region to ensure the effectiveness of the information obtained. The performance of the proposed method for a nonlinear, non-convex, and high dimensional reliability analysis is validated by three numerical cases. The results indicate the high efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.

AB  - For practical system problems, all response values of the component performance function can be obtained by running an expensive computational model once. In current adaptive Kriging-based methods for system reliability analysis, only one or all the component Kriging models are updated in each iteration. The former may waste computational resources, whereas the latter has the problem of overfitting. To improve the efficiency and stability of these problems, this study proposes a new active learning method for system reliability analysis, where a specific number of component Kriging models are refined in each iteration, rather than updating only one or all the component kriging models, as in the existing methods. First, a new learning function based on an approximate estimation of the error probability of the system is proposed. Subsequently, two strategies are proposed to stabilize the adaptive Kriging-based algorithms. Finally, five examples are used to compare the proposed approach with the other existing active Kriging-based methods. Practical validations show that the proposed method outperforms the other methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and stability.

AB  - Surrogate models are useful for reducing the computational burden in real applications. Structural reliability analyses based on active learning kriging models, such as efficient global reliability analysis (EGRA) and an active learning method to combine kriging and MCS (AK-MCS), have been widely proposed. However, these methods are mainly suitable for component reliability analyses. In general, the reliability analysis of practical engineering problems is mostly performed at the system level with multiple failure models. Two representative system reliability methods, i.e., an adaptation of the AK-MCS method for system reliability (AK-SYS) and system reliability analysis through active learning kriging model with truncated candidate region (ALK-TCR), are very useful for system reliability analysis with only random variables. However, these methods select training points from the perspective of component responses and are difficult to implement for complex systems. Therefore, the balance between applicability, accuracy and efficiency can be further improved. In this study, an efficient reliability method for structural systems with multiple failure modes is proposed to further extend the AK-SYS and ALK-TCR. A new learning function based on the system structure function, which efficiently take into account the influence of the different components and their logical arrangement through the use of the system's structure function, is developed to select the added points adaptively from the perspective of the system. Based on the proposed learning function, surrogate models are accurately constructed. Compared to AK-SYS and ALK-TCR, the proposed method has the following three main advantages: (1) the new learning function selects the added points from the perspective of the system to fully and directly utilize the predicted information of all the components; (2) the magnitude effect, which refers to the several orders of magnitude existing among the responses of components, have no influence on the proposed method; and (3) the proposed method is robust and has high applicability for complex systems. Four numerical examples are investigated to show the applicability and efficiency of the proposed method, and the results indicate that the proposed method is effective for system reliability analysis.

AB  - To improve the efficiency and accuracy of reliability assessment for structures with small failure probability and time-consuming simulation, a new structural reliability analysis method (RCA-PCK) is proposed, which combines PC-Kriging model and radial centralized adaptive sampling strategy. Firstly, the PC-Kriging model is constructed by improving the basis function of Kriging model with sparse polynomials. Then, the sampling region which contributes a great impact on the failure probability is constructed by combining the radial concentration and important sampling technology. Subsequently, thek-means++ clustering technology and learning function LIF are adopted to select new training samples from each subdomains in each iteration. To avoid the sampling distance in one subdomain or the distance between the new training samples in two subdomains being too small, we construct a screening mechanism to ensure that the selected new training samples are evenly distributed in the limit state. In addition, a new convergence criterion is derived based on the relative error estimation of failure probability. Four benchmark examples are given to illustrate the convergence process, accuracy and stability of the proposed method. Finally, the transmission error reliability analysis of thermal-elastic coupled gears is carried out to prove the applicability of the proposed method RCA-PCK to the structures with strong nonlinearity and time-consuming simulation.

AB  - This paper explores the application of active learning strategies to adaptively learn Sobol indices for global sensitivity analysis. We demonstrate that active learning for Sobol indices poses unique challenges due to the definition of the Sobol index as a ratio of variances estimated from Gaussian process surrogates. Consequently, learning strategies must either focus on convergence in the numerator or the denominator of this ratio. However, rapid convergence in either one does not guarantee convergence in the Sobol index. We propose a novel strategy for active learning that focuses on resolving the main effects of the Gaussian process (associated with the numerator of the Sobol index) and compare this with existing strategies based on convergence in the total variance (the denominator of the Sobol index). The new strategy, implemented through a new learning function termed the MUSIC (minimize uncertainty in Sobol index convergence), generally converges in Sobol index error more rapidly than the existing strategies based on the Expected Improvement for Global Fit (EIGF) and the Variance Improvement for Global Fit (VIGF). Both strategies are compared with simple sequential random sampling and the MUSIC learning function generally converges most rapidly for low -dimensional problems. However, for high -dimensional problems, the performance is comparable to random sampling. The new learning strategy is demonstrated for a practical case of adaptive experimental design for large-scale Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel experiments.

AB  - Slope reliability analysis can effectively account for uncertainties involved in a slope system. However, commonly used slope reliability analysis methods often require huge computational cost, especially in large-scale problems, which hinders its wide application to engineering practice. This paper proposes an efficient slope reliability analysis method based on the active learning support vector machine (SVM) and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The proposed method makes use of an active learning function and cross-validation techniques to select the most suitable training samples to update the SVM model. The selected training samples are associated with a small distance to the limit state surface of the slope stability model and a large local uncertainty, which are more informative to gradually tune the SVM model to approximate the actual slope performance function. As a result, the proposed method can estimate the slope reliability with a small number of evaluations of the slope performance function, thus improving the efficiency significantly. Four slope examples are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The presented approach is also compared with some other commonly used surrogate models in slope reliability analysis. It is shown that the proposed method performs better in terms of computational efficiency to obtain similar estimation accuracy of the failure probability for the investigated examples.

AB  - The time-dependent failure credibility (TDFC) can reasonably measure the safety level of the time-dependent structure under the fuzzy uncertainty, but the direct optimization algorithm to estimate the TDFC requires large computational cost and even results in locally optimal solutions. Therefore, an efficient method is proposed for estimating the TDFC by combining the fuzzy simulation and the single-loop Kriging model. In the proposed method, fuzzy inverse transformation theorem is firstly used to transform the estimation of the TDFC into a sample classification problem, in which the candidate sample pool generated by fuzzy simulation (FS) is classified into the failure group and the safety one. For improving the efficiency of the classification, a Kriging model is adaptively trained by an elaborate U-learning function in the candidate sample pool. After the candidate sample is divided into the failure group and the safety one by the convergent Kriging model, the TDFC can be estimated as a byproduct easily. The innovation of the proposed method includes two aspects: establishing the idea of the fuzzy simulation combined with the single-loop Kriging model to estimate TDFC efficiently and robustly, and designing an elaborate U-learning function to improve the efficiency of training the single-loop Kriging model. The presented examples validate the efficiency of the proposed method under the acceptable precision.

AB  - Learning function-on-scalar predictive models for conditional densities and identifying factors that influence the entire probability distribution are vital tasks in many data-driven applications. We present an efficient Majorization-Minimization optimization algorithm, Wasserstein Distributional Learning (WDL), that trains Semi-parametric Conditional Gaussian Mixture Models (SCGMM) for conditional density functions and uses the Wasserstein distance W-2 as a proper metric for the space of density outcomes. We further provide theoretical convergence guarantees and illustrate the algorithm using boosted machines. Experiments on the synthetic data and real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed WDL algorithm.

We present new strategies for an efficient compiler-based solution using MLIR to accelerate linear interpolation. For real-world machine-learned multi-layer lattice models that use multidimensional linear interpolation, we show these strategies run 5 - 10x faster on a standard CPU compared to an optimized C++ interpreter implementation.

AB  - Integral learning functions are theoretically sound but suffer from intensive computational complexity induced by the associated double integral. Based on a new notation of limit-state margin volume, a computationally-cheap integral learning function called Expected margin volume reduction (EMVR) is proposed for structural reliability analysis. EMVR has two key contributions. First, closed-form expression for the inner integral is well derived based on Kriging update formulas, due to tractable definition of the margin volume. This gets rid of cumbersome numerical quadrature or drawing massive realizations of Gaussian process. Second, a confined integral domain is rationally defined for the outer integral, by virtue of exploring the locality of its integrand. This bypasses annoying computer memory issue. Moreover, a hybrid stopping condition coupled with two different settings of the associated parameters is deployed, accommodating to reliability problems with different features. Then, the performance of EMVR-based reliability algorithm is illustrated on four numerical examples. The results show that the evaluation time of EMVR is reduced to a level comparable to pointwise learning functions. Moreover, it outperforms those existing learning functions in terms of both computational accuracy and efficiency.

AB  - To address the substantial computational burden associated with probability density evolution method (PDEM) in structural reliability analysis, this study proposes a novel look -ahead learning function named stepwise truncated variance reduction (STVR), integrating polynomial chaos Kriging (PCK) and PDEM. Three key features of STVR are highlighted. First, it enables quantifying the maximum reduction in predictive errors of PCK within the regions of interest (ROI) when adding a new point. Second, closed -form expression for STVR is derived through Kriging update formulas, eliminating the need for computationally intensive Gauss-Hermite quadrature or extensive conditional simulations of PCK. Third, a dynamic adjustment procedure is proposed for the probability level -related parameter in STVR, with the aim of achieving a good balance between the exploitation and exploration of ROI during the sequential experimental design process. The performance of STVR is demonstrated through two benchmark analytical functions and three numerical examples of varying complexity. Results indicate that the dynamic adjustment procedure for the probability level -related parameter in STVR outperforms the empirical setting of a minor value. Then, STVR proves more advantageous than existing pointwise and look -ahead learning functions, particularly in addressing complex dynamic reliability problems.

AB  - Many schizophrenic patients exhibit impairments in neurocognitive functions. Typical antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol, have limited or even detrimental influence on cognitive functions. In contrast, atypical antipsychotic drugs, such as clozapine and olanzapine, may improve memory function in schizophrenics, However, only a few studies have been conducted to directly compare the effects of olanzapine, clozapine and haloperidol on memory functions in animal models. Thus, their effects on this issue were investigated in the present studies by using one-way step-through passive avoidance task and Morris water maze as models of learning and memory. The results showed that olanzapine did not affect acquisition, consolidation or retrieval process in step-through test. Moreover, it improved spatial learning function in mice in Morris water maze task. Clozapine and haloperidol appeared to impair acquisition process and consolidation process, respectively, in step-through test. Both drugs impaired spatial learning function in mice in Morris water maze task. The results suggested a positive implication for the clinical medication of olanzapine in schizophrenic treatment.

AB  - A major challenge in structural reliability is that computational accuracy and efficiency are hard to balance, especially the time-variant hybrid reliability problem. To improve the reliability analysis efficiency under the condition that the accuracy is assured, this paper develops a new learning function named Regional Learning with Weighted Simulation (RLWS) to estimate the failure probability. The Kriging model is first employed as a response surface to fit the response of limit state function. An adaptive regional learning model as the core of the most probable point is then proposed to update the Kriging model, where the boundary of the updated region is determined by an attenuation function. Furthermore, based on the RLWS model, this paper develops a continuous maximin salp swarm algorithm to calculate the upper bound of the response value for time-variant hybrid performance function. Meanwhile, the Salp Swarm Algorithm is employed to calculate the lower bound of the response value. The Monte Carlo simulation can thus facilitate evaluation based on the final generated Kriging response surface. Several case studies are performed to test and validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its applicability to practical engineering problems.

AB  - For the widely existing time-dependent structural system (TDSS), the current model ignores the interaction among multiple modes in the minimum transformation of the performance function of each mode w.r.t. the time, it may misjudge the state of the system at some instants and result in the error of estimating the reliability. To avoid this possible mistake, this paper proposes an improved reliability analysis model for the TDSS. In the proposed model, the TDSS performance function is transformed into the single-mode time-dependent performance function firstly according to the relationship of multiple modes. Then the failure probability of the TDSS can be estimated by the single-mode time-dependent performance function. The relationship of multiple modes is strictly considered in the proposed model. On the basis of the improved model, this paper also presents the Kriging surrogate model combined with the Monte Carlo simulation method to estimate the failure probability of the TDSS. In this Kriging method, the initial training samples are uniformly selected in the sample space and a new extremum learning function is proposed. Theoretical analysis verifies the rationality of the proposed reliability analysis model, and the efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated by the results of numerical examples.

AB  - In the existing method combining adaptive Kriging and fuzzy simulation (AK-FS) for estimating the failure possibility, the AK is required to correctly identify the state of each sample point in the candidate sample pool of FS. However, the states of some sample points have no contributions to the accuracy of estimating the failure possibility, and identifying their states by the existing AK-FS only results in a loss of efficiency. Therefore, this paper proposes a new probability learning strategy to improve the efficiency of the existing AK-FS. According to the theory of failure possibility, when taking the product of the failure domain indicator function and the joint membership function as the failure pointer of the point, failure possibility is the maximum, and the corresponding point is called fuzzy design point. Based on the probabilistic prediction property of Kriging, the proposed strategy establishes a global strategy. The probability of the failure indicator at arbitrary candidate point greater than the predicted maximum failure pointer is analytically derived for the single and multiple failure modes, respectively, and this probability represents the degree of the point to be fuzzy design point, thus it can be used to measure the contribution of the point to improve the accuracy. By adaptively adding the points with the largest contribution to the training sample set, the real failure possibility can be approximated gradually. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed strategy are verified by several examples.

AB  - Reducing the cost of calculation without compromising the accuracy of the solution is a recognized challenge for optimizing the reliability analysis, which became possible using surrogate models trained with robust techniques, such as active learning Kriging (AK) reliability methods. In the AK reliability method, a Kriging predictor is built with a small size of design of experiments (DoE) and becomes more accurate in the vicinity of the limit state function (LSF) in a stepwise manner, called the learning process, until a stopping criterion is met. The motivation of the current study is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of AK reliability analysis by developing new learning functions, new stopping criteria, and a new method of selection of the next candidate for updating the DoE in the learning process. In this paper, two new learning functions named Kriging occurrence (KO) and weighted KO (WKO) are proposed based on a probability-based approach. A hybrid selection for the next candidate is introduced which simultaneously considers the probability of improvement and the density of DoE and a new stopping criterion is recommended based on the relative mean of the learning functions. A thorough study of the literature is conducted where 12 learning functions are summarized and their performances are compared to that of newly developed learning functions through five comparative examples. The result of the study shows that the new learning function can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the learning process.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel single-loop procedure for time-variant reliability analysis based on a Kriging model. A new strategy is presented to decouple the double-loop Kriging model for time-variant reliability analysis, in which the extreme value response in double-loop procedure is replaced by the best value in the current sampled points to avoid the inner optimization loop. Consequently, the extreme value response surface for time-variant reliability analysis can be directly established through a single-loop Kriging surrogate model. To further improve the accuracy of the proposed Kriging model, two methods are provided to adaptively choose a new sample point for updating the model. One method is to apply two commonly used learning functions to select the new sample point that resides as close to the extreme value response surface as possible, and the other is to apply a new learning function to select the new point. Synchronously, the corresponding different stopping criteria are also provided. It is worth nothing that the proposed single-loop Kriging model for time-variant reliability analysis is for a single time-variant performance function. To verify the proposed method, it is applied to four examples, two of which have with random process and others have not. Other popular methods for time-variant reliability analysis including the existing single-loop Kriging model are also used for the comparative analysis and their results testify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Cumulative time-dependent failure probability function (C-T-FPF) can reflect the effects of distribution parameters of random inputs and the upper bound of service time interval, which vary in their design domains, on timedependent failure probability. However, solving C-T-FPF involves a time-consuming triple-layer framework. Thus, we propose an efficient method by combining cross-entropy-based importance sampling (IS) with adaptive Kriging model (CE-IS-AK). The innovations of CE-IS-AK include two aspects. Firstly, we construct a space augmented by both distribution parameters and the upper bound of service time interval, on which the triplelayer framework is decoupled to a single-layer one. And in the augmented space, an optimal IS density is proposed to reduce the required candidate sample size for estimating C-T-FPF. Secondly, we employ Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to approximate the optimal IS density, and the parameters in GMM are determined by minimizing the cross entropy of GMM and the optimal IS density. Moreover, to reduce the model evaluations in the proposed method, Kriging model is adaptively embedded to replace the actual model, and a first failure instant based learning function is proposed to train Kriging model adaptively. Due to the proposed single-layer framework and IS strategy assisted by the Kriging model, the efficiency is greatly improved for estimating C-TFPF, which is validated by several examples.

AB  - Various adaptive reliability analysis methods based on surrogate models have recently been developed. A multi -mode failure boundary exploration and exploitation framework (MFBEEF) was proposed for system reliability assessment using the adaptive kriging model based on sample space partitioning to reduce computational cost and use the characteristics of the failure boundary in multiple failure mode systems. The efficiency of the adaptive construction of kriging model can be improved by using the characteristics of the center sample of the small space to represent the characteristics of all samples in the small space. This method proposes a failure boundary exploration and exploitation strategy and a convergence criterion based on the maximum failure probability error for a system with multiple failure modes to adaptively approximate the failure boundary of a system with multiple failure modes. A multiple-failure-mode learning function was used to identify the optimal training sample to gradually update the kriging model during the failure boundary exploration and exploitation stages. In addition, a complex failure boundary-oriented adaptive hybrid importance sampling method was developed to improve the applicability of the MFBEEF method to small failure probability assessments. Finally, the MFBEEF method was proven to be effective using five system reliability analysis examples: a series system, a parallel system, a series-parallel hybrid system, a multi-dimensional series system with multiple failure modes, and an engineering problem with multiple implicit performance functions.

AB  - According to the concept of limit-state margin probability function, a new look-ahead learning function called stepwise margin reduction (SMR) is proposed for active learning reliability analysis. SMR aims to select the best next point as the one minimizing, in expectation, the integrated margin probability function when adding such a new point. The plain definition of SMR involves a double integral, and three-fold contributions are made to reducing the associated computational burden. First, the closed-form expression of inner integral is well deduced, which avoids burdensome Gaussian-Hermite quadrature or drawing simulations of Gaussian process. Second, thanks to the locality of analytical expression of inner integral, truncated-integral scheme (TIS) is devised for the outer integral to avoid serious computer memory issue. Third, the candidate pool is pruned to accelerate the selection of best next point per iteration. The efficacy of SMR-based active learning reliability method is illustrated on two analytical functions, three numerical examples and one real-world engineering problem. Results demonstrate that in SMR, the TIS performs better than the traditional limited-integral scheme. Then, in comparison with existing pointwise and look-ahead learning functions, SMR gains favorable advantage in term of both computational accuracy and efficiency.

AB  - The effect of adjuvant therapy with the radical scavenger alpha -phenyl-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN; 100 mg/kg given intraperitoneally every 8 h for 5 days) on brain injury and learning function was evaluated in an infant rat model of pneumococcal meningitis. Meningitis led to cortical necrotic injury (median, 3.97% [range, 0%-38.9%] of the cortex), which was reduced to a median of 0% (range, 0%-30.9%) of the cortex (P <.001) by PBN. However, neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus was increased by PBN, compared with that by saline (median score, 1.15 [range, 0.04-1.73] vs. 0.31 [range, 0-0.92];). Learning function 3 weeks after cured infection, as assessed by the Morris water maze, was decreased, compared with that in uninfected control animals (P<.001). Parallel to the increase in hippocampal apoptosis, PBN further impaired learning in infected animals, compared with that in saline-treated animals (P<.02). These results contrast with those of an earlier study, in which PBN reduced cortical and hippocampal neuronal injury in group B streptococcal meningitis. Thus, in pneumococcal meningitis, antioxidant therapy with PBN aggravates hippocampal injury and learning deficits.

AB  - Soil Tillage serious game designed as a training media has been researched based on the plowing forces using polynomial functions. However, the learning process is rare; hence the players in Serious Games (SG) are less engaged and tend to be more static in their games. The effects of vertical cutting angle, plowshare depth, and motor speed affect the soil plowing force in soil tillage. Therefore it is expected that a plow force model with a learning function will generate more actual conditions, engage the player and eventually affect the player's behavior. The serious game design uses a Hierarchical Finite State Machine (HFSM) in this study. HFSM state is motor speed, vertical cutting angle, and plowing depth. The learning function is based on Neural Network (NN), with a multilayer feed-forward neural network (FFNN) is chosen to estimate plowing forces. The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is used by NN to approach second-order training speed without computing the Hessian matrix and is the fastest backpropagation algorithm. The result of the research is a plowing force model values closer to the actual by giving players feedback as they learn. In the transition, HFSM has a feedback value to the initial state, which is helpful as part of measuring one game cycle that is run, thus providing a learning experience in a serious game.

AB  - A Bayesian reinforcement learning reliability method that combines Bayesian inference for the failure probability estimation and reinforcement learning -guided sequential experimental design is proposed. The reliability -oriented sequential experimental design is framed as a finite -horizon Markov decision process (MDP), with the associated utility function defined by a measure of epistemic uncertainty about Kriging-estimated failure probability, referred to as integrated probability of misclassification (IPM). On this basis, a one-step Bayes optimal learning function termed integrated probability of misclassification reduction (IPMR), along with a compatible convergence criterion, is defined. Three effective strategies are implemented to accelerate IPMRinformed sequential experimental design: (i) Analytical derivation of the inner expectation in IPMR, simplifying it to a single expectation. (ii) Substitution of IPMR with its upper bound IPMRU to avoid element -wise computation of its integrand. (iii) Rational pruning of both quadrature set and candidate pool in IPMRU to alleviate computer memory constraint. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated on two benchmark examples and two numerical examples. Results indicate that IPMRU facilitates a much more rapid reduction of IPM compared to other existing learning functions, while requiring much less computational time than IPMR itself. Therefore, the proposed reliability method offers a substantial advantage in both computational efficiency and accuracy, especially in complex dynamic reliability problems.

AB  - In this paper, SBSC+SRU: an error-guided adaptive Kriging modeling method is proposed for the system reliability analysis with multiple failure modes. Therein, the accuracies of Kriging models will be improved by a novel learning function, in which the magnitude of Component Limit State Functions (CLSFs), uncertainties of Kriging models, and the coupling relationships among CLSFs are considered to identify the location and component index of the new sample. Then, the maximum estimated relative error of predicted failure probability is derivated by quantifying the probability of wrong sign prediction of samples. To be specific, the highly uncertain samples are first defined, after that the probability of wrong sign prediction of each highly uncertain sample is deduced combining the predictions of Kriging models and coupling relationship among all CLSFs. Therefore, the proposed approach knows the real-time estimated error and could terminate the adaptive updating process under the accuracy requirement. Three numerical examples including parallel and series system problems and an engineering case concerning the system reliability analysis of a stiffened cylindrical shell are studied to validate the performance of the proposed method. Results demonstrate that the proposed method converges to the required estimated accuracy while saving considerable computational burdens compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

In many cases the NP-hard problems of finding sparsest solutions can be replaced by l(1)-problems from convex optimisation theory, which provide effective tools for semi-supervised learning. We present several conjectures and examples.

AB  - PurposeMechanical products usually require deterministic finite element analysis in the design phase to determine whether their structures meet the requirements. However, deterministic design ignores the influence of uncertainties in the design and manufacturing process of mechanical products, leading to the problem of a lack of design safety or excessive redundancy in the design. In order to improve the accuracy and rationality of the design results, a robust design method for structural reliability based on an active-learning marine predator algorithm (MPA)-backpropagation (BP) neural network is proposed.Design/methodology/approachThe MPA was used to obtain the optimal weights and thresholds of a BP neural network, and an active-learning function applicable to neural networks was proposed to efficiently improve the prediction performance of the BP neural network. On this basis, a robust optimization design method for mechanical product reliability based on the active-learning MPA-BP model was proposed. Random moving quadrilateral sampling was used to obtain the sample points required for training and testing of the neural network, and the reliability sensitivity corresponding to each sample point was calculated by subset simulated significant sampling (SSIS). The total mass of the mechanical product and the structural reliability sensitivity of the trained active-learning MPA-BP model output were taken as the optimization objectives, and a multi-objective reliability-robust optimization design model was constructed, which was solved by the second-generation non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). Then, the dominance function was used in the obtained Pareto solution set to make a dominance-seeking decision to obtain the final reliability-robust optimization design solution. The feasibility of the proposed method was verified by a reliability-robust optimization design example of the bogie frame.FindingsThe prediction error of the active-learning MPA-BP neural network was smaller than those of the particle swarm optimization (PSO)-BP, marine predator algorithm (MPA)-BP and genetic algorithm (GA)-BP neural networks under the same basic parameter settings of the algorithm, which indicated that the improvement strategy proposed in this paper improved the prediction accuracy of the BP neural network.

AB  - Time-dependent reliability analysis with high dimensional outputs is a challenge because of 'curse of dimen-sionality' and accurate reliability estimation over entire time interval is computationally expensive. In this paper, an efficient time-dependent reliability analysis method is proposed for systems with high dimensional outputs based on adaptive dimension reduction strategy and Kriging. The adaptive Kriging model is constructed in low -dimensional space after performing principal component analysis (PCA) on original time-dependent output. A new learning function and corresponding stopping criterion are developed as the guideline for selecting training samples at each iteration. The proposed learning function focuses on prediction accuracy over the entire time interval and the stopping criterion is directly linked to failure probability. Subsequently, fewer number of function evaluations is required compared with existing competitive works. Moreover, the key advantage of the proposed method is that it is a single-loop process, i.e., the selection of training samples, dimension reduction and Kriging modeling have been combined simultaneously at each iteration with adaptive manner. However, the existing competitive methods, generally, have two independent stages, i.e., stage one is collecting training samples and stage two is performing PCA and Kriging modelling for time-dependent reliability analysis. Thus, these methods cannot fully utilize the information provided by PCA to find optimal training samples. It is noteworthy that the dimension reduction is also an adaptive process in the proposed method, i.e., dimension reduction changes with the training samples at each iteration. The applicability, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are validated through three numerical examples and one engineering example.

AB  - Robust design optimization (RDO) is one of the most popular methodologies in the presence of uncertainties, which aims to provide an insensitive design configuration. However, the assessment of the robustness index is computationally intensive for practical engineering. Surrogate assisted optimization is an effective way to reduce the computational expense. Various surrogate models have been used in RDO, such as support vector regression, Kriging, artificial neural network, radial basis function and so on. Recently, a new surrogate model named PC-GK-SBL is proposed, combining the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) and Gaussian kernel (GK) in the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework. In this paper, the PC-GK-SBL surrogate model is integrated into RDO, and the analytical formulae for the robustness index and its sensitivity are derived, which improves computational efficiency significantly. Furthermore, an adaptive active learning function, named robust local geometrical exploration (RLGE), is also proposed to select the new sample points for updating the surrogate model, in which the sigmoid function is combined with distance based geometrical exploration strategy to improve the accuracy of the RDO solution significantly. In RLGE, the sigmoid function is utilized to filter out the design spaces that have little influence on the robustness index, and the geometrical exploration is employed to avoid crowding of the added samples for the surrogate model. The RLGE active learning function is evaluated by a metaheuristic algorithm, the comprehensive learning Harris hawks-equilibrium optimization. Finally, the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method were demonstrated through four numerical examples and one engineering example.

AB  - The Internet of Thing (IoT) network deployments are widely investigated in 4G and 5G systems and will still be key technical systems to drive massive connectivity of 6G systems. In 6G, IoT systems will operate with 6G new technologies such as Integrated Sensing and Communications. The IoT systems of 6G will be a platform to collect information in real world and create new use cases and business models. As the IoT devices and cellular networks are getting smarter, the IoT ecosystem allows us to bridge between human life and digital life and accelerate the transition towards a hyper-connected world. Optimal and scalable IoT network design has been investigated in many research groups but key challenges in this topic still remain. An IoT devices deployment problem is investigated to minimise the transmission and computation cost among network nodes. The IoT devices deployment problem is formulated as Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming problem. After relaxing the constraints and transforming the problem to a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem, the authors propose a new branch and bound (BB) method with a machine learning function and solve the MILP problem as a sub-optimal solution. In the numerical analysis, the authors evaluate both conventional BB method and the proposed BB method with weighting factors and compare the objective function values, the number of explored nodes, and computational time. The performances of the proposed BB method are significantly improved under the given simulation configuration. The author finds the optimal mapping of IoT devices to fusion nodes.
   The main contributions of this paper are (1) IoT network deployment problem formation as MILP problem to optimise the transmission among network nodes, and (2) New BB method with a machine learning function to reduce the computational complexity. image

AB  - Uncertainty analysis (UA) is the process that quantitatively identifies and characterizes the output uncertainty and has a crucial implication in engineering applications. The research of efficient estimation of structural output moments in probability space plays an important part in the UA and has great engineering significance. Given this point, a new UA method based on the Kriging surrogate model related to closed-form expressions for the perception of the estimation of mean and variance is proposed in this paper. The new proposed method is proven effective because of its direct reflection on the prediction uncertainty of the output moments of metamodel to quantify the accuracy level. The estimation can be completed by directly using the redefined closed-form expressions of the model's output mean and variance to avoid excess post-processing computational costs and errors. Furthermore, a novel framework of adaptive Kriging estimating mean (AKEM) is demonstrated for more efficiently reducing uncertainty in the estimation of output moment. In the adaptive strategy of AKEM, a new learning function based on the closed-form expression is proposed. Based on the closed-form expression which modifies the computational error caused by the metamodeling uncertainty, the proposed learning function enables the updating of metamodel to reduce prediction uncertainty efficiently and realize the decrease in computational costs. Several applications are introduced to prove the effectiveness and efficiency of the AKEM compared with a universal adaptive Kriging method. Through the good performance of AKEM, its potential in engineering applications can be spotted.

AB  - To improve the efficiency of random vibration analysis of the train-bridge system, a new approach is proposed based on the adaptive sampling (AS) surrogate model in this paper. First, an initial sample set and a candidate sample set are generated by the method based on Generalized F (GF)-discrepancy. Second, a theoretical model is used to calculate the maximum dynamic response of the train-bridge system corresponding to the initial sample set, and a surrogate model based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) is constructed. Third, the learning function is used to identify new samples in the candidate sample set to optimize the current surrogate model until it meets satisfactory prediction accuracy. Finally, the maximum dynamic response of each sample in the representative sample set is predicted by the final surrogate model, and then the statistical properties of the dynamic response of the train-bridge system are analyzed. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the distribution of training sample points and prediction accuracy of the AS surrogate model and the one-stage sampling (OS) surrogate model are compared and analyzed, taking the prediction of the maximum wheel load reduction rate (WLRR) of a train on the bridge as an example. On this basis, the prediction accuracy of the AS and OS surrogate models for the random characteristics of the train on the bridge is evaluated. The results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of the surrogate model without increasing the number of training samples.

AB  - In recent years, offshore wind power generation technology has developed rapidly around the world, making important contributions to the further development of renewable energy. When designing an Offshore Wind Turbine (OWT) system, the uncertainties in parameters and different types of constraints need to be considered to find the optimal design of these systems. Therefore, the Reliability -Based Design Optimization (RBDO) method is usually adopted to ensure the stability and reliability of the design scheme. However, the calculation cost is huge in the RBDO problem considering mixed uncertainties. The Kriging model is a widely used approximation technique to reduce the computational cost in RBDO. However, establishing a sufficiently accurate Kriging model for a complex engineering system often requires the collection of more sample data and more time-consuming performance evaluation. In order to solve this problem, this study proposes a hybrid RBDO method based on a Portfolio allocation strategy. Based on ensuring the accuracy of the Kriging model, this method requires fewer iterations than the previous method of iteratively establishing the Kriging model using the same learning function. Furthermore, the optimal design of the system can be completed in a shorter time. This has great application potential to reduce the time labor and material costs spent in the design process of OWT. Two mathematical examples and two engineering examples are used to verify the accuracy of the method. Then, the proposed method is used in the design and optimization of a typical OWT support structure, showing the method's feasibility and superiority.

AB  - In the context of structural system reliability, quantifying the relative importance of random input variables and failure modes is necessary for improving system reliability and simplifying the reliability-based design problems. We firstly introduce the reliability-based variable importance analysis (VIA) indices to structural systems for quantifying the individual, interaction and total effects of each random input variable on the system failure probability, and propose two new reliability-based mode importance analysis (MIA) indices for measuring the effects of each failure mode on the failure and safety of structural systems. Then, an active learning procedure, which combines the multiple response Gaussian process (MRGP) model and the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), is introduced to efficiently and adaptively produce surrogate models for the failure surfaces of systems, and three learning functions are compared. Based on the well-established surrogate models, the system failure probability as well as the VIA and MIA indices are estimated without calling the limit state functions in addition. Results of six test examples demonstrate the significance of the VIA and MIA indices, and show that the developed MRGP-based methods are effective in estimating both the system failure probability and the proposed importance indices.

AB  - Bayesian model updating is a powerful tool for system identification and model calibration as new measurements or observations become available. At present, Bayesian updating with structural reliability methods (BUS) is an efficient and easy-to-implement method, which can transform the multi-dimensional integration in Bayesian updating into a reliability problem by introducing an auxiliary variable. However, the efficiency and accuracy of BUS are dependent on the constant c in the performance function constructed in BUS for some reliability methods, while c is not available in advance generally. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient Bayesian updating method with two-step adaptive Kriging (AK), which is named as BUS-AK2, where both c and the transformed reliability problem can be efficiently solved by AK. In the proposed method, BUS-AK2 first constructs the Kriging model of likelihood function by expected improvement (EI) learning function, and the maximum of likelihood function and c can be obtained. Then the Kriging model of the performance function in BUS is constructed, where U learning function is employed to obtain samples from the posterior distribution. In addition, for the BUS problem with a small acceptance rate, combined global and local sampling technique is incorporated into the proposed method to further improve modeling efficiency. Examples show that the proposed method has obvious computational advantages for the BUS problem with a small acceptance rate and multiple observations.

AB  - Reliability analysis of a complex system is challenging because of complex failure regions and frequent requirement of time-consuming simulations. To address these problems, combining adaptive surrogate models with Monte Carlo simulation has received considerable attention in recent years. The core of existing adaptive methods is the construction of an effective learning function as the guideline to select new training samples. In this paper, a new learning function with a parallel processing strategy is proposed for selecting new training samples for complex systems. It combines dependent Kriging predictions and parallel learning strategy to further improve the computational efficiency. Using the proposed parallel learning strategy for system reliability problems, one or several new training samples can be selected at each iteration to refine the constructed surrogate models. This causes the total number of iterations to decrease. Compared with existing adaptive Kriging-based system methods, the proposed method offers the following advantages: (1) it is capable of parallel processing, i.e., multiple training samples can be selected at each iteration for refinement to reduce the overall computational time, (2) it is easy to implement for complex systems regardless of their structure, and (3) it is generally more effective than most existing methods. Three numerical examples are investigated to demonstrate the proposed method, and the results show that it has high applicability and accuracy for complex reliability problems.

AB  - Adaptive Kriging combined with Monte Carlo simulation (AK-MCS) is popularly used to estimate the failure probability, but its candidate sample pool (CSP) size should be large enough to guarantee the accuracy of failure probability estimation, especially for small failure probability. To select training point for updating the Kriging model, AK-MCS needs to traverse the CSP to calculate the it-learning function of every point, which is time-demanding. Thus, an enhanced AK-MCS (shorten as EAK-MCS I) is proposed by use of an efficient CSP reduction strategy. In EAK-MCS I, the candidate samples are classified into two types, i.e., the samples with accurately judged states and the other samples. Obviously, removing the first type samples from CSP does not need extra computational cost, which has no effect on the precision of estimating failure probability and can improve the efficiency of training Kriging model. Hence, EAK-MCS I is more efficient than AK-MCS in estimating failure probability. Additionally, for the risk of misjudging the states of the samples by the Kriging model trained in the reduced CSP for complicated problem, another version of EAK-MCS I (shorten as EAK-MCS II) is proposed by nesting an adaptive strategy to calibrate the Kriging model. The proposed methods improve the efficiency of AK-MCS and inherit all advantages of AK-MCS.

Although varieties of sampling strategies have been proposed, they update DoE mainly by selecting the sample at which its corresponding learning function value is the maximum or minimum. However, there are usually two drawbacks. First, the training samples in DoE are easily clustered or overlapped. Second, the existing strategies usually only consider the improvement of prediction accuracy at the new training sample rather than the accuracy improvement of the region near the new training sample. Unfortunately, these two drawbacks can cause some unnecessary performance function evaluations. Therefore, an efficient adaptive sampling strategy and reliability analysis algorithm based on Kriging model, weighted average misclassification rate, sampling uniformity and gradient of prediction uncertainty are proposed. Furthermore, an improved stopping criterion based on the relative error estimation of failure probability is also developed to further reduce iteration. Subsequently, two explicit examples from the literature are analyzed to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. Finally, a truss structure subjected to six external loads is investigated to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed reliability analysis method in engineering applications.

AB  - Bayesian active learning methods have emerged for structural reliability analysis and shown more attractive features than existing active learning methods. However, it remains a challenge to actively learn the failure probability by fully exploiting its posterior statistics. In this study, a novel Bayesian active learning method termed 'Parallel Bayesian Probabilistic Integration' (PBPI) is proposed for structural reliability analysis, especially when involving small failure probabilities. A pseudo posterior variance of the failure probability is first heuristically proposed for providing a pragmatic uncertainty measure over the failure probability. The variance amplified importance sampling is modified in a sequential manner to allow the estimations of posterior mean and pseudo posterior variance with a large sample population. A learning function derived from the pseudo posterior variance and a stopping criterion associated with the pseudo posterior coefficient of variance of the failure probability are then presented to enable active learning. In addition, a new adaptive multi-point selection method is developed to identify multiple sample points at each iteration without the need to predefine the number, thereby allowing parallel computing. The effectiveness of the proposed PBPI method is verified by investigating four numerical examples, including a turbine blade structural model and a transmission tower structure. Results indicate that the proposed method is capable of estimating small failure probabilities with superior accuracy and efficiency over several other existing active learning reliability methods.

AB  - Surrogate models have been widely adopted for reliability analysis. The common approach is to construct a series of surrogates based on a training set and then pick out the best one with the highest accuracy as an approximation of the time-consuming limit state function. However, the traditional method increases the risk of adopting an inappropriate model and does not take full advantage of the data devoted to constructing different surrogates. Furthermore, obtaining more samples is very expensive and sometimes even impossible. Therefore, to save the cost of constructing the surrogate and improve the prediction accuracy, an ensemble strategy is proposed in this paper for efficiently analyzing the structural reliability. The values of the weights are obtained by a recursive process and the leave-one-out technique, in which the values are updated in each iteration until a given prediction accuracy is achieved. Besides, a learning function is used to guide the selection of the next sampling candidate. Because the learning function utilizes the uncertainty estimator of the surrogate to guide the design of experiments (DoE), to accurately calculate the uncertainty estimator of the ensemble of surrogates, the concept of weighted mean square error is proposed. After the high-quality ensemble of surrogates of the limit state function is available, the Monte Carlo method is employed to calculate the failure probabilities. The proposed method is evaluated by three analytic problems and one engineering problem. The results show that the proposed ensemble of surrogates has better prediction accuracy and robustness than the stand-alone surrogates and the existing ensemble techniques.

AB  - Evidence theory-based reliability analysis (ETRA) is investigated in this paper. To estimate the plausibility (Pl) and belief (Bel) measures of failure probability, the active learning method based on Kriging model for ETRA (ALK-ETRA) has been proposed. However, ALK-ETRA pays too much attention to rightly predicting the signs of performance function at points throughout the uncertain space. To minimize the waste of training points, an enhanced version of ALK-ETRA (En-ALK-ETRA) is proposed in this paper. Pl or Bel is determined by the sign associated with an individual joint focal element (JFE) rather than a single point. Based on this idea, a brand-new learning function and a novel stopping condition are proposed in En-ALK-ETRA. Aided by the new learning function, the most dangerous JFE in which the lower (or upper) bound of performance function has the largest probability of wrong sign prediction is identified. The added training point is chosen from the most dangerous JFE and thus the convergence speed of learning process is accelerated. In the new stopping condition, the number of JFEs where the minimum (or maximum) of performance function with wrong sign predictions is explicitly deduced and thus the error of ETRA can be estimated. The error of ETRA is real-time monitored and thus the learning process is timely terminated without accuracy sacrifice. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by six case studies.

AB  - The surrogate model-based sampling method has been an active area of research due to its evident efficiency over direct sampling method. The fusion of the adaptive kriging (AK) model with the adaptive radial-based importance sampling (ARBIS) method is developed as an improvement of the AK model combined with Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method especially for estimating the small failure probabilities. In the AK-ARBIS method, the number of candidate samples in each updating process of the kriging model is reduced through partitioning the whole MCS sample domain into different subdomains and removing the samples inside the last subdomain from the participating candidate sampling pool, which can avoid the time-consuming matrix operation involved in kriging predictions in order to find the best training sample in each updating step. In the existing AK-ARBIS method, kriging model stops updating according to the U learning function-based stopping criterion, which cannot directly reflect the error of the estimated failure probability. In this regard, this paper proposes the error-based stopping criterion (ESC) enhanced AK-ARBIS method, where the processes of finding the optimal hypersphere and accurately identifying the sign of candidate samples are decoupled in order to successfully embed the ESC. In addition to embedding the ESC into the AK-ARBIS method, two target-oriented candidate sampling reduction strategies are investigated, respectively, to improve the efficiency of finding the optimal hypersphere and accurately identifying the sign of the participating candidate samples. Based on the candidate sampling pool reduction strategies and ESC, both the computational time and the required number of calls to the real limit state function are reduced over the existing AK-ARBIS method. Three case studies are analyzed to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed enhanced AK-ARBIS method, especially for estimating the small failure probabilities.

The iterative learning law combines a PD-type learning function and state feedback, where only a relatively small number of parameters need to be tuned. The analysis is extended to allow different finite frequency range performance specifications, where this facility is relevant to many applications. The design computations required are linear matrix inequality based. The new design is illustrated by a simulation based study on robotic manipulator behavior, where the model used has been constructed from experimental data.

AB  - For efficiently estimating the fuzzy failure probability under the probability inputs and fuzzy state assumption (profust model) which generally includes three states, i.e., the absolute safety state, the full failure state and the fuzzy safety-failure transition state, a novel step-wise AK-MCS method is proposed. In the first step, the Kriging model is adaptively updated by U learning function to accurately recognize if the points in the sample pool are in the safety state or in the failure one, where the exact values of performance function at these points are not concerned in the process of updating the Kriging model. After the Kriging model converges so that all points of the sample pool in the absolute safety state and the fully failure state can be well distinguished, the retained points in the sample pool belong to the fuzzy safety-failure transition state and construct the reduced new sample pool. In the second step, the first converged Kriging model continues to be adaptively updated in the reduced new sample pool. The exact values of the performance function at these points locating in the fuzzy safety-failure transition state are concerned for accurately estimating the fuzzy failure probability. Thus, a global learning function based on the total prediction error is used to select training point in order to update the Kriging model. By using the step-wise strategy and collaborating Kriging surrogates through two-step updating processes with different learning functions, the fuzzy failure probability can be efficiently estimated as a post-processing without any extra calls of the performance function. An automobile front model, a simplified wing box structure model and an icing forecast model are used to illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.

AB  - Sequential sampling methods have gained significant attention due to their ability to iteratively construct surrogate models by sequentially inserting new samples based on existing ones. However, efficiently and accurately creating surrogate models for high-dimensional, nonlinear, and multimodal problems is still a challenging task. This paper proposes a new sequential sampling method for surrogate modeling based on a hybrid metric, specifically making the following three contributions: (1) a hybrid metric is developed by integrating the leave-one-out cross-validation error, the local nonlinearity, and the relative size of Voronoi regions using the entropy weights, which well considers both the global exploration and local exploitation of existing samples; (2) a Pareto-TOPSIS strategy is proposed to first filter out unnecessary regions and then efficiently identify the sensitive region within the remaining regions, thereby improving the efficiency of sensitive region identification; and (3) a prediction-error-and-variance (PE&V) learning function is proposed based on the prediction error and variance of the intermediate surrogate models to identify the new sample to be inserted in the sensitive region, ultimately improving the efficiency of the sequential sampling process and the accuracy of the final surrogate model. The proposed sequential sampling method is compared with four state-of-the-art sequential sampling methods for creating Kriging surrogate models in seven numerical cases and one real-world engineering case of a cutterhead of a tunnel boring machine. The results show that compared with the other four methods, the proposed sequential sampling method can more quickly and robustly create an accurate surrogate model using a smaller number of samples.

AB  - We have been concerned with a recognition of partial and short term intentions, "i.e. micro-level intention recognition," to which conventional methods are not applicable because of action duration uncertainty. Our approach to micro-level intention recognition is to deal with a vehicle driving task as a typical application and to apply a pattern learning function which discovers and utilizes synchronous and temporal relations among the multi-dimensional time-series data of both user and environment. In this paper, appropriate sensor settings of the vehicle for intention recognition are examined by Support Vector Machine (SVM).

AB  - In many fields of science and engineering, models with different fidelities are available. Physical experiments or detailed simulations that accurately capture the behavior of the system are regarded as high-fidelity models with low model uncertainty; however, they are expensive to run. On the other hand, simplified physical experiments or numerical models are seen as low-fidelity models that are cheaper to evaluate. Although low-fidelity models are often not suitable for direct use in reliability analysis due to their low accuracy, they can offer information about the trend of the high-fidelity model thus providing the opportunity to explore the design space at a low cost. This study presents a new approach called adaptive multi-fidelity Gaussian process for reliability analysis (AMGPRA). Contrary to selecting training points and information sources in two separate stages as done in stateof-the-art mfEGRA method, the proposed approach finds the optimal training point and information source simultaneously using the novel collective learning function (CLF). CLF is able to assess the global impact of a candidate training point from an information source and it accommodates any learning function that satisfies a certain profile. In this context, CLF provides a new direction for quantifying the impact of new training points and can be easily extended with new learning functions to adapt to different reliability problems. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by three mathematical examples and one engineering problem concerning the wind reliability of transmission towers. It is shown that the proposed method achieves similar or higher accuracy with reduced computational costs compared to state-of-the-art single and multi-fidelity methods. A key application of AMGPRA is high-fidelity fragility modeling using complex and costly physics-based computational models.

AB  - Availability of the information related to the medical tests are wide and thus the demand for advanced analysis is continuously growing. In the recent past, a number of automatic disease detection algorithms are generated. The studies focus on various life threatening diseases such as cardiovascular diseases or cervical diseases or cancerous growth in tissues or non-malignant tumours. Nevertheless, considering various reports from the health organizations and government survey reports, the researchers have highest focus on cardiovascular diseases. The major area of focus is to determine or predict the possibilities of heart diseases based on predictive analysis. It is been learnt from the parallel research outcomes that the use of neural network based analytical frameworks are highly accurate for these purposes. The majority of the research attempts have demonstrated the use of single activation function for determining the predictive value. Nonetheless, the activation functions have significantly different properties and the effective selection of the activation function can generate higher accuracy. In the other hand ineffective selection of the activation functions, may also lead to incorrect determination of the disease and disease severity. Thus for a clinical decision support system, it is very crucial to have effective activation function in the framework. Hence, this work attempts to identify the characteristics of these activation functions and provides a framework for dynamic selection of the activation function based on the nature of the dataset. Also, the training strategies for any neural model play a major role for disease detection and prediction, which is again subjected to the time complexity of the learning function. Nevertheless, this work proposes to identify the optimal deep learning function by deploying the proposed framework. The major outcome of this work demonstrates nearly 96% accuracy for disease prediction due to the dynamic selection of the activation function and establishes the novelty of the research by defining the severity of the diseases.

TI  - A General Representation Learning Framework with Generalization Performance Guarantees
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING, VOL 202
CP  - 40th International Conference on Machine Learning
AB  - The generalization performance of machine learning methods depends heavily on the quality of data representation. However, existing researches rarely consider representation learning from the perspective of generalization error. In this paper, we prove that generalization error of representation learning function can be estimated effectively by solving two convex optimization problems. Based on it, we propose a general representation learning framework. And then, we apply the proposed framework to two most commonly used nonlinear mapping methods, i.e., kernel based method and deep neural network (DNN), and thus design a kernel selection method and a DNN boosting framework, correspondingly. Finally, extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Based the inter-arrival times of data packets obtained from the learning function, the mean of these inter-arrival times is the possible sniff interval; according to the backlog packets in the buffer space and forecast next burst data traffic, a cost model is used to approximate the slot occupancy assigned to a slave. Consequently, calculate sniff attempt slots, and go into sniff mode if conditions are satisfied. Finally, computer simulation results validate that the proposed scheduling policy can save about 38.6% power consumption compared to the always active mode.

Departing from linear approximations and inverse most probable point (iMPP) calculations, AK-IRs utilizes an active learning Kriging approach with proposed learning functions and discrimination criteria for precise limit state identification. This method focuses training points near the limit state, ensuring precise approximations in complex nonlinear scenarios. By constructing high-precision Kriging models without relying on gradient information, AK-IRs significantly enhances solution efficiency in IRA challenges. Numerical assessments and a real-world engineering case study validate the effectiveness of AK-IRs.

The noncausal filter Q(q) and learning function L(q) are simultaneously optimized by solving a convex optimization problem. The proposed method is applied to a non-minimal phase system and compared with a model-inversion based ILC design. Using the developed ILC design the underlying trade-off between tracking performance and convergence speed is thoroughly/quantitatively analyzed. (C) 2016 European Control Association.

AB  - In this paper, we bring into the scheduling field a new model of the learning effect, where in two ways the existing approach is generalized. First we relax one of the rigorous constraints, and thus in our model each job can provide different experience to the processor. Second we formulate the job processing time as a non-increasing k-stepwise function, that, in general, is not restricted to a certain learning curve, thereby it can accurately fit every possible shape of a learning function. Furthermore, we prove that the problem of makespan minimization with the considered model is polynomially solvable if every job provides the same experience to the processor, and it becomes NP-hard if the experiences are diversified. The most essential result is a pseudopolynomial time algorithm that solves optimally the makespan minimization problem with any function of an experience-based learning model reduced into the form of the k-stepwise function.

AB  - Though the truss optimization with frequency constraints is very complicated due to its high nonlinear property, the importance and necessity of truss optimization in the real engineering design render it attractive for many researchers. This paper proposed a new heuristic algorithm inspired by the observation of the learning behavior of individuals in a group for the truss optimization with frequency constraints. The new swarm intelligent heuristic algorithm called the medalist learning algorithm has a concise implementation procedure composed of two key operations: identifying the medalists and conducting the individual learning. The learning period is divided into predefined learning stages. In each learning stage, a learning efficiency is generated using a learning function originated from the natural learning function. The key operations mentioned above are repeated in each learning stage. For an excellent performer called medalist, to conduct individual learning is to carry out self-learning trials; but for a common learner, to conduct individual learning is to learn from his/her past experi-ence and imitate the medalists. Six well-known truss optimization problems were employed to verify the effi-ciency of the new algorithm. The results obtained by the medalist learning algorithm were compared with those previously reported in literature. The new algorithm outperforms the others in terms of the best and average weights. The computational cost measured by the number of the function estimations of the structure for the new algorithm to obtain the best design usually is in the middle of the reported costs. In some cases, the new algo-rithm has the lowest worst weight and smallest number of function estimations.

AB  - Failure possibility (FP) is widely used to measure safety degree of structure in the presence of fuzzy uncertainty, but how to quantify the effect of fuzzy distribution parameter on FP is seldom investigated. For searching the important parameter to FP and guiding the FP-based design optimization, the local sensitivity of FP (LS-FP) is firstly defined by the partial derivative of FP with respect to the fuzzy distribution parameter in this paper. Then, the analytical solution is derived for the LS-FP in special cases; a universal algorithm is proposed to solve LS-FP by use of the fuzzy simulation. The proposed universal algorithm includes three creative steps. The first is explicitly expressing FP as the joint membership function of the fuzzy inputs at the fuzzy most possible failure point (F-MPP) by use of the fuzzy simulation, on which LS-FP can be equivalently transformed as the partial derivative of F-MPP with respect to the fuzzy distribution parameter. The second is using the characteristic of F-MPP to derive the analytical solution of the partial derivative of F-MPP. The third is establishing an efficient method to estimate F-MPP for completing LS-FP, where new learning function and stopping criterion are proposed to improve the computational efficiency. The proposed algorithm has no limitation on the nonlinearity of performance function and can be applied in any fuzzy membership distribution form of the fuzzy input. Several examples are used to validate the wide applicability, the accuracy, and the efficiency of the proposed algorithm to solve LS-FP.

AB  - Folic acid (FA) plays an important role in the maintenance of normal neurological functions such as memory and learning function. Neuroinflammation contributes to the progression of cognitive disorders and Alzheimer's disease. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effect of FA supplementation on cognitive impairment, oxidative stress, and neuro-inflammation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injured rats. For this purpose, the rats were given FA (5-20 mg/kg/day, oral) for 3 weeks. In the third week, LPS (1 mg/kg/day; intraperitoneal injection) was given before the Morris water maze (MWM) and passive avoidance (PA) tests. Finally, the brains were removed for biochemical assessments. In the MWM test, LPS increased the escape latency and traveled distance to find the platform compared to the control group, whereas all doses of FA decreased them compared to the LPS group. The findings of the probe trial showed that FA increased the traveling time and distance in the target area. LPS impaired the performance of the rats in the PA test. FA increased delay and light time while decreasing the frequency of entry and time in the dark region of PA. LPS increased hippocampal levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1 beta. The hippocampal level of malondialdehyde was also increased but thiol content and superoxide dismutase activity were decreased in the LPS group. However, treatment with FA restored the oxidative stress markers along with a reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, FA could ameliorate the memory and learning deficits induced by LPS via normalizing the inflammatory response and oxidative stress markers in the brain.

AB  - For geotechnical systems involving complex behaviors and significant uncertainties, metamodeling-based reliability methods based on fixed designs of experiment (passive metamodeling methods) are frequently applied. However, because of the passive nature of these methods, they do not guarantee accurate probability estimates. This issue also persists in estimates obtained from active metamodeling methods (metamodeling methods that update the design of experiment iteratively) if a global stopping criterion or a nonoptimal learning function is used for the type of problem. This study highlights the importance of addressing these issues by investigating an example of failure analysis of soil slopes and concludes that the stopping criteria for development and refinement of metamodels need to be objective and locally defined with respect to the limit state function (LSF) and with a direct link to the accuracy of the reliability estimates. To address these challenges, this study established an effective sampling region that optimally ignores candidate design samples with weak probability densities. This enabled the development of an effective learning function that facilitates the active learning process. Moreover, an analytical upper bound for the error in failure probability estimation, proposed by the authors, was adopted here to arrive at a local and objective stopping criterion. This method was applied on two soil slopes, the stability of which was evaluated by the strength reduction method (SRM) in FLAC3D. The results highlight that passive and active methods with global stopping criteria cannot guarantee an accurate estimate of the failure probability. Furthermore, the developed method can considerably reduce the computational demands while achieving accurate estimates of failure probabilities of soil slopes.

AB  - This paper investigates a novel approach to efficiently construct and improve surrogate models in problems with high-dimensional input and output. In this approach, the principal components and corresponding features of the high-dimensional output are first identified. For each feature, the active subspace technique is used to identify a corresponding low-dimensional subspace of the input domain; then a surrogate model is built for each feature in its corresponding active subspace. A low-dimensional adaptive learning strategy is proposed to identify training samples to improve the surrogate model. In contrast to existing adaptive learning methods that focus on a scalar output or a small number of outputs, this paper addresses adaptive learning with high-dimensional input and output, with a novel learning function that balances exploration and exploitation, i.e., considering unexplored regions and high-error regions, respectively. The adaptive learning is in terms of the active variables in the low-dimensional space, and the newly added training samples can be easily mapped back to the original space for running the expensive physics model. The proposed method is demonstrated for the numerical simulation of an additive manufacturing part, with a high-dimensional field output quantity of interest (residual stress) in the component that has spatial variability due to the stochastic nature of multiple input variables (including process variables and material properties). Various factors in the adaptive learning process are investigated, including the number of training samples, range and distribution of the adaptive training samples, contributions of various errors, and the importance of exploration versus exploitation in the learning function.

AB  - In parallel with the development of information and network technology, large amounts of data are being generated by the Internet, and data-driven methodologies are now often being used in decision-making. Recent studies have investigated personalized individual semantics (PIS) in various decision-making contexts to model a fact that words mean different things to different people. However, few studies have investigated PIS in the context of multi-attribute decision-making (MADM). In MADM, in addition to multi attribute linguistic information, pre-existing classification of the alternatives is always present, which have not been considered in prior research. Most previous studies have simply demonstrated the feasibility of PIS methods with numerical examples using small-scale models, and not with realistic datasets. Therefore, in this study, we propose a data-driven learning model to analyze the PIS of decision makers to support a multi-attribute decision-making model that considers pre-existing classification of the alternatives. Specifically, we first propose a PIS multi-attribute learning function to define a general computation form for comprehensive evaluation of the value of alternatives. Then, considering this pre-existing classification of the alternatives, a PIS learning model is constructed by analyzing the relations between calculated values of alternatives and corresponding class assignments to obtain personalized numerical scales of linguistic terms for a decision maker. Finally, we present a case study based on two datasets and a comparison with other methods to justify the feasibility of the proposed model.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Learning range restricted Horn expressions
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL LEARNING THEORY
CP  - 4th European Conference on Computational Learning Theory
AB  - We study the learnability of first order Horn expressions from equivalence and membership queries. We show that the class of range restricted Horn expressions, where every term in the consequent of every clause appears also in the antecedent of the clause, is learnable. The result holds both for the model where interpretations are examples (learning from interpretations) and the model where clauses are examples (learning from entailment).
   The paper utilises a previous result on learning function free Horn expressions. This is done by using techniques for flattening and unflattening of examples and clauses, and a procedure for model finding for range restricted expressions. This procedure can also be used to solve the implication problem for this class.

AB  - In the transaction process, the effective negotiation may cause more profits. In B2C and C2C, sellers only can use the fixed price or auction because they have no time and energy to bargain with buyers who are random on time and quantity, which reduces the benefits and successful transaction rate. This article established a negotiation model to solve this problem. This model conforms to the general negotiation flow and involves Bayesian learning function. In original Bayesian learning, the conditional probability is hard to obtain. The shortcoming is remedied in this model. It makes this negotiation model simple, effective and have learning ability.

The control parameter of the neuron is the wiring pattern among the registers and thus they are suitable for on-chip learning. In this paper an asynchronous discrete-state spiking neuron is introduced and its typical nonlinear phenomena are demonstrated. Also, a learning algorithm for a set of neurons is presented and it is demonstrated that the algorithm enables the set of neurons to reconstruct nonlinear dynamics of another set of neurons with unknown parameter values. The learning function is validated by FPGA experiments.

AB  - This article presents an improvement of Monte Carlo simulations to perform efficiently structural reliability analysis. The proposed algorithm is called AK-MCS for Active learning method combining Kriging and Monte Carlo Simulation. It uses Monte Carlo Simulation without evaluating the whole population on the computational expensive performance function. To do so, a Kriging classification model based on very few evaluations is used to predict precisely only the sign of the performance function for the whole Monte Carlo population. Moreover, a learning function is proposed to select wisely the evaluations to perform in order to improve the quality of the Kriging model. The method is performed on two examples. It is proved to guarantee a great accuracy on the probability of failure with only a few calls to the mechanical model.

The Kriging model is constructed to substitute for expensive finite-element analysis of engineering problem during optimization and reliability analysis. To improve the interpolation accuracy of Kriging, a learning function is adopted in adaptive sampling process. A weight index form of MCS method is proposed to enhance the efficiency of conventional MCS method. Finally, taking the result of conventional MCS as a reference, proposed reliability analysis method is compared with reliability index approach and sensitivity-assisted MCS methods.

AB  - This paper presents a novel approach to synthesize automatically age-progressed facial images in video sequences using Deep Reinforcement Learning. The proposed method models facial structures and the longitudinal face-aging process of given subjects coherently across video frames. The approach is optimized using a long-term reward, Reinforcement Learning function with deep feature extraction from Deep Convolutional Neural Network. Unlike previous age-progression methods that are only able to synthesize an aged likeness of a face from a single input image, the proposed approach is capable of age-progressing facial likenesses in videos with consistently synthesized facial features across frames. In addition, the deep reinforcement learning method guarantees preservation of the visual identity of input faces after age-progression. Results on videos of our new collected aging face AGFW-v2 database demonstrate the advantages of the proposed solution in terms of both quality of age-progressed faces, temporal smoothness, and cross-age face verification.

AB  - Recently, the topic of scheduling with learning effects has kept growing attention, and a survey is further provided to classify the learning models in scheduling into two types, namely position-based leaning and sum-of-processing-times-based learning. However, the actual processing time of a given job fast drops to zero as the number of jobs increases in the first model and when the normal job processing times are large in the second model. Motivated by this observation, this paper extends both models to a more general learning model where the actual job processing time is a function of the sum of the logarithm of the processing times of the jobs already processed and general position-based leaning. Under the proposed leaning model, this paper shows that some single-machine scheduling problems can be solved in polynomial time.

The self-learning function is used to adapt to the diversity of the runway road surface friction, the particle swarm algorithm is used to optimize the rate of self-learning, and robust control is used to deal with the modeling uncertainty and external disturbance of the system. The convergence of the control strategy is proved by theoretical analysis and simulation experiments. The superiority and accuracy of the method are verified by NASA ground test results. The simulation results shows that the adverse effect of the external disturbance is suppressed, and the ideal trajectory is tracked.

AB  - The kriging-based adaptive structural reliability analysis method has become widely used, and various learning functions have been proposed. In this study, a fast convergence strategy (FCS) for adaptive structural reliability analysis is proposed based on the Kriging Believer criterion and importance sampling. FCS considers the improvement in the accuracy of the failure probability estimation instead of overemphasizing the approximation accuracy of the limit state function. Contribution of samples to the accuracy of failure probability estimation is quantified based on the Kriging Believer criterion. FCS can implement sequence and parallel additions. The optimal importance sampling function is constructed to further improve the efficiency of the FCS. Several examples are used to demonstrate that FCS can efficiently and accurately handle complex limit state function and the engineering problem of implicit functions.

AB  - To improve the accuracy and efficiency of solving structural reliability problems with highly nonlinear black box functions, this paper proposes an active learning Kriging approach for structural reliability analysis based on an improved learning strategy of the Improved Wolf Pack Algorithm (IWPA). Firstly, we optimize the kriging surrogate model by IWPA. Secondly, a parallel plus point strategy named IWPA-NLF which is based on IWPA and a new learning function (NLF) is used to update the kriging surrogate model. Finally, the subset simulation (SS) method is used to calculate the reliability. A numerical example and three engineering examples are used to verify the proposed method in this paper. The results show that the proposed method in this paper has a strong function fitting ability and can calculate the accurate failure probability with fewer performance function calls.

AB  - A Random pattern search method (RPS) for learning multi-layer artificial neural network is proposed. As a derivative-free direct search algorithm, the proposed learning model provides a very simple and effective means of searching the. minima of art objective function directly without any knowledge of its derivatives. Furthermore, by incorporating a random mechanism, it also has some chance of escaping from local minima by permitting temporary error increases during learning. Thus the network may eventually reach the global minimum state or its best approximation with higher probability. We test this algorithm on several benchmark problems, such as exclusive-or (XOR), parity, alphabetic character learning, function approximation problems and a real world classification task. Simulation results show that the systems can be trained efficiently by our method for all problems.

AB  - In order to enhance the customer experience, it is important not only to provide functions, but also to respond to changes in environments and requirements. It is a difficult task to evaluate and manage which function with different locations and contents is most valuable to the user's experience without using computationally time-consuming optimization calculations. To address this, this paper is focusing on self-adaptive software technology. The authors built a software adaptation mechanism that can be immediately calculated online using a performance characteristic map and threshold judgment with a learning function and sequential updates. The results confirmed the effectiveness of the mechanism in an application that supports personnel exchange events.

AB  - We present in this paper a variation of the self-organising map algorithm where the original time-dependent (learning rate and neighbourhood) learning function is replaced by a time-invariant one. This allows for on-line and continuous learning on both static and dynamic data distributions. One of the property of the newly proposed algorithm is that it does not fit the magnification law and the achieved vector density is not directly proportional to the density of the distribution as found in most vector quantisation algorithms. From a biological point of view, this algorithm sheds light on cortical plasticity seen as a dynamic and tight coupling between the environment and the model. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The lower and upper bounds of probability of failure are calculated based on the final constructed surrogate models. The proposed reliability analysis method can be used for systems with mixed variables. The proposed method is applicable to any existing surrogate models. A numerical example is investigate to show the applicability of the proposed method.

AB  - Hot metal desulphurization pretreatment process has characteristics of multivariate and nonlinear, the sulfur content of hot metal can not be monitored online, it's difficult to set the amount of desulfurating agent accurately. To solve this problem, a model of RBF neural network was proposed based on production data of desulphurization. The model improved quality of the modeling data by removing outliers with similarity coefficient method. Simplified the model structure and reduced data noise by eliminating correlation of the modeling data with PCA method. Improved generalization ability with subtractive clustering algorithm and improved network error learning function. Simulation results show that the model is high accuracy and can determine the amount of desulfurating agent accurately.

T2  - BIOINFORMATICS
AB  - Motivation: Microscopy technology plays important roles in many biological research fields. Solvent-cleared brain high-resolution (HR) 3D image reconstruction is an important microscopy application. However, 3D microscopy image generation is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, we have developed a deep learning framework (DeepS) for both image optical sectioning and super resolution microscopy.
   Results: Using DeepS to perform super resolution solvent-cleared mouse brain microscopy 3D image yields improved performance in comparison with the standard image processing workflow. We have also developed a web server to allow online usage of DeepS. Users can train their own models with only one pair of training images using the transfer learning function of the web server.

TI  - Predict plus Optimise with Ranking Objectives: Exhaustively Learning Linear Functions
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE TWENTY-EIGHTH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
CP  - 28th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence
AB  - We study the predict+optimise problem, where machine learning and combinatorial optimisation must interact to achieve a common goal. These problems are important when optimisation needs to be performed on input parameters that are not fully observed but must instead be estimated using machine learning. Our contributions are two-fold: 1) we provide theoretical insight into the properties and computational complexity of predict+optimise problems in general, and 2) develop a novel framework that, in contrast to related work, guarantees to compute the optimal parameters for a linear learning function given any ranking optimisation problem. We illustrate the applicability of our framework for the particular case of the unit-weighted knapsack predict+optimise problem and evaluate on benchmarks from the literature.

T2  - 2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON IT IN MEDICINE & EDUCATION, VOLS 1 AND 2, PROCEEDINGS
CP  - IEEE International Symposium on IT in Medicine and Education
AB  - In this study, we assessed the large sample population of patients with chronic gastritis based on three methods with supervised learning function, i.e., the regression analysis, BP neural network and Support Vector Machine. On basis of the results, we constructed the diagnostic models to predict the types of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndromes of chronic gastritis, and compared the correct rate and applicability of each method. The study showed the correct rate of prediction was as follows: Support Vector Machine > BP neural network > regression analysis, after construction of diagnostic models with three algorithms. We believe, our results could be of great value in exploring the methodology of objectification and standardization of TCM Syndromes.

AB  - In this paper, a neural sliding mode control approach is developed to adjust the sliding gain using a radial basis function (RBF) neural network (NN) for the tracking control of Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) triaxial vibratory gyroscope. First a sliding mode control with a fixed sliding gain is proposed to assure the asymptotic stability of the closed loop system. Then a RBF neural network is derived to adjust the sliding gain using a gradient method in a switching control law. With the adaptive sliding gain using the learning function of RBF neural network, the chattering phenomenon is eliminated. Numerical simulation is investigated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed neural sliding mode control scheme.

The data transfer must be performed on their common interface due to the non-matching meshes for different domains. The adaptive Kriging interpolation method is proposed based on the greedy algorithm. By introducing a learning function, the Kriging interpolation model is constructed by the source grid values. In this way, part of the total source points are selected and the Kriging model is of high precision for the data transfer between the interface. Four examples are investigated to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.

AB  - Recent experiments have shown the importance of statistical learning in infant language acquisition. Computational models of such learning, however, often take the form of corpus analyses and are thus difficult to connect to empirical data. We report a cross-situational learning experiment which demonstrates robust individual differences in learning between infants. We then present a novel generative model of cross-situational learning combining two competing processes - habituation and association. The model's parameters are set to best reproduce each infant's individual looking behavior from trial-to-trial in training and testing. We then isolate each infant's word-referent learning function to explain the variance found in preferential looking tests.

Since learning functions have been widely applied, we take this group of functions as an example to demonstrate the proposed procedure. Based on the concept of Support Vector Machine (SVM), three major stages of preliminary pruning, fitting function, and refining are proposed to discover a subset that possess the characteristics of some learning function from the given large data set. Three models were used to illustrate and evaluate the proposed pruning procedure and the results have shown to be promising in application.

AB  - When location shifts occur, cointegration-based equilibrium-correction models (EqCMs) face forecasting problems. We consider alleviating such forecast failure by updating, intercept corrections, differencing, and estimating the future progress of an 'internal' break. Updating leads to a loss of cointegration when an EqCM suffers an equilibrium-mean shift, but helps when collinearities are changed by an 'external' break with the EqCM staying constant. Both mechanistic corrections help compared to retaining a pre-break estimated model, but an estimated model of the break process could outperform. We apply the approaches to EqCMs for UK M1, compared with updating a learning function as the break evolves. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a framework for assessing the reliability of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP)-strengthened reinforced concrete (RC) beams in flexure using stochastic nonlinear finite-element (SNFE) analysis and k-w-means clustering, based on active-learning kriging Monte Carlo simulation (AK-MCS), in which spatial variations in the concrete and bond material properties are considered. A computer algorithm was developed to augment commercially available nonlinear finite-element (FE) analysis software and automate the process for conducting the SNFE clustering-based AK-MCS analysis. The k-w-means clustering was based on the U learning function to provide multipoint enrichment to improve convergence of the stopping criteria by allowing parallel computation of the SNFE models. Parametric analysis indicated the accuracy of the reliability prediction of the examined member and proved the efficiency of the proposed analysis in reducing the number of calls to SNFE models compared with data in the existing literature, when using probability-based stopping criteria.
   The quality of the FRP-to-concrete bond is affected by the integrity of the concrete at the interface, which varies across the dimensions of the strengthened member, causing added uncertainty in predicting the structural response, and hence the reliability of the FRP-strengthened member. This study proposes a computationally efficient approach to assess the reliability of FRP-strengthened concrete members by considering the spatial variation in the concrete properties (compressive strength, tensile strength, bulk modulus) and the quality of the FRP-to-concrete bond (shear and normal bond strength) by using an adaptive machine-learning technique. The proposed framework may be utilized by engineers to design FRP-strengthening systems for concrete members experiencing variation in the concrete properties due to poor quality control or active deterioration.

AB  - Structural reliability analysis, when accounting for non-parameterized probability box (P-box) uncertainty, typically entails multiple calls to performance functions and poses significant computational hurdles, largely attributable to its inherently nested double-loop structure. Therefore, this paper proposes a new reliability analysis method tailored for structures with uncertain parameters represented using non-parameterized P-boxes. This method leverages double-loop deep learning models to efficiently calculate both the upper and lower bounds of the failure probability. In the development phase of the double-loop deep learning model, an active learning function is devised that integrates the local prediction uncertainty of the deep learning model, based on the K-fold cross-validation principle with the proximity of training samples to candidate sample points. Different stopping criteria are formulated at distinct stages of the model construction process. Firstly, within the inner loop, a deep learning model is established to represent the original performance function in relation to the input parameters. Secondly, based on the inner-loop deep learning model for the performance function, an outer-loop deep learning model is established for the auxiliary response function corresponding to the P-box bound curves of the performance function response with respect to standard uniform distribution variables. Thirdly, utilizing the outer-loop deep learning approximate model, the Monte Carlo simulation technique is employed to compute the upper and lower bounds of the structural failure probability. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through the investigation of two numerical examples and a practical engineering problem. The influence of parameters in the active learning function, threshold values for stopping criteria, and the number of sample points on the computational results is deliberated.

Specifically, the multiple-channel adaption-learning-function synchronization iterative learning control (MASILC) method we give uses a multiple-channel approach based on A-type of ILC, with adaptive parameters to address the divergence situation caused by stochastic noises in different channels. We verify the superiority of the MASILC method and analyze its stability and convergence performance in theory. Furthermore, we introduce an effective adaptive method inspired by the stochastic acceleration optimization method. Simulation comparisons with analogous approaches demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in various circumstances.

AB  - This study evaluates the predictions made by Logan's ''race model of automaticity'' through computer simulation. Logan's use of extreme value theory assumes that each memory trace that enters the race must be sampled from the same Weibull distribution. Since Logan tests his theory empirically between individuals, this implies a fixed effect assumption for the Weibull distribution that produces each individuals reaction time. Logan's model predicts that the inverse of the Weibull shape parameter for reaction times equals the learning function exponent for the reaction times. This implies that all individual's learning exponents are equal. We demonstrate through stimulation that the failures in Logan's model can be predicted by assuming heterogeneity of learning exponents across individuals.

AB  - In this paper the replacement of a lost learning function of rats through a computer-based real-time recording and feedback system is shown. In an experiment two recording electrodes and one stimulation electrode were implanted in an anesthetized rat. During a classical-conditioning paradigm, which includes tone and airpuff stimulation, biosignals were recorded and the stimulation events detected. A computational model of the cerebellum acquired the association between the stimuli and gave feedback to the brain of the rat using deep brain stimulation in order to close the eyelid of the rat. The study shows that replacement of a lost brain function using a direct bidirectional interface to the brain is realizable and can inspire future research for brain rehabilitation.

AB  - In order to effectively and accurately assess the failure probability of mechanical structures, this paper proposes a multi-point sampling active learning reliability analysis method called AKMP. First, a GA-Halton sequence is introduced to make the initial samples well dispersed and homogeneous in the design space. Second, a new learning function FELF is constructed to efficiently update the Kriging model, which takes into account the relationship between the location of the sampling points and the performance fun. Then, a combination of NCC criterion and multipoint sampling strategy is proposed to further improve the convergence efficiency, which can effectively terminate the active learning process. Finally, numerical and engineering cases are tested to verify the application performance of the proposed AKMP. The results show that the method has superior performance in terms of both accuracy and failure probability efficiency, and can reduce the computational resources of the active learning process.

AB  - The observable degree can be used to directly explain the system filtering performance (or filtering accuracy) of Kalman filtering (KF) to some extent. The effective observable degree can not only be obtained before filtering but also be used to measure the system filtering performance. In applications, the exact knowledge of the system parameters and models is always unavailable. A basic smart Kalman filter (SKF) with online performance evaluation is proposed based on the observable degree in this paper. Since the collection of observations is limited in initial alignment with complex situations, mobile sensor networks are introduced. To improve the filtering performance with inaccuracy system parameters, the relatively optimal smart adjusting factor is iteratively selected by an optimized observable degree with autonomous learning function. The self-assessment function is also available for real-time performance evaluation. Finally, simulation examples are demonstrated to validate the proposed smart Kalman filter. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - To solve the problem of large computation when failure probability with time-consuming numerical model is calculated, we propose an improved active learning reliability method called AK-SSIS based on AK-IS algorithm [1]. First, an improved iterative stopping criterion in active learning is presented so that iterations decrease dramatically. Second, the proposed method introduces Subset simulation importance sampling (SSIS) into the active learning reliability calculation, and then a learning function suitable for SSIS is proposed. Finally, the efficiency of AK-SSIS is proved by two academic examples from the literature. The results show that AK-SSIS requires fewer calls to the performance function than AK-IS, and the failure probability obtained from AK-SSIS is very robust and accurate. Then this method is applied on a spur gear pair for tooth contact fatigue reliability analysis.

AB  - In this article, we propose an active kriging-based learning method for hybrid reliability analysis (HRA) with random and interval variables. An improved sampling strategy is proposed to target the sampling areas. Samples with maximum responses greater than 0 and minimum responses less than 0 are selected and regarded as the candidate samples; then, a U-based learning function is developed in which multiple samples of the interval are considered instead of one particular sample. To terminate the proposed method, a hybrid convergence criterion is proposed. Finally, an improved optimization strategy based on the DIRECT algorithm is developed for the Monte Carlo simulation conducted for the HRA. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by four numerical cases. The results illustrate that the proposed method is accurate and efficient for HRA.

AB  - Attributed network embedding enables joint representation learning of node links and attributes. Existing attributed network embedding models are designed in continuous Euclidean spaces which often introduce data redundancy and impose challenges to storage and computation casts. To this end, we present a Binarized Attributed Network Embedding model (BANE for short) to learn binary node representation. Specifically, we define a new Weisfeiler-Lehman proximity matrix to capture data dependence between node links and attributes by aggregating the information of node attributes and links from neighboring nodes to a given target node in a layer-wise manner. Based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman proximity matrix, we formulate a new Weisfiler-Lehman matrix factorization learning function under the binary node representation constraint. The learning problem is a mixed integer optimization and an efficient cyclic coordinate descent (CCD) algorithm is used as the solution. Node classification and link prediction experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed BANE model outperforms the state-of-the-art network embedding methods.

AB  - The sparrow search algorithm (SSA) has received widespread attention as an emerging group intelligence algorithm. In this study, a QSAR (quantitative structure-activity relationship) prediction model for anti-ER alpha (Estrogen receptor alpha, an important target for the treatment of breast cancer) compounds and their bioactivity data was constructed based on a sparrow search algorithm optimized BP neural network combined with the selected relevant parameter indicators. Then the created model was used to predict the biological activity of the compounds. The results show that the created model not only has a certain self-learning function, but also improves the convergence speed and the accuracy of the prediction results compared with the BP neural network model optimized by genetic algorithm (which is more complex in coding and slower in solving, but has good solution accuracy). Further, it was demonstrated that the use of SSA-BP could improve the prediction of QSAR for anti-ER alpha compounds.

AB  - We propose a new model of motor learning to explain the exceptional dexterity and rapid adaptation to change, which characterize human motor control. It is based on the brain simultaneously optimizing stability, accuracy and efficiency. Formulated as a V-shaped learning function, it stipulates precisely how feedforward commands to individual muscles are adjusted based on error. Changes in muscle activation patterns recorded in experiments provide direct support for this control scheme. In simulated motor learning of novel environmental interactions, muscle activation, force and impedance evolved in a manner similar to humans, demonstrating its efficiency and plausibility. This model of motor learning offers new insights as to how the brain controls the complex musculoskeletal system and iteratively adjusts motor commands to improve motor skills with practice.

AB  - In this paper, Bayesian support vector regression (SVR) model is developed for structural reliability analysis adaptively. Two SVR models, namely, least-square SVR and epsilon-SVR, are constructed under the Bayesian inference framework with a square loss function and a epsilon-insensitive square one respectively. In this framework, a Gaussian process prior is assigned to the regression function, and maximum posterior estimate results in a SVR problem. The proposed Bayesian SVR models provide point-wise probabilistic prediction while keeps the structural risk minimization principle, and it allows us to determine the optimal hyper-parameters by maximizing Bayesian model evidence. Two active learning algorithms are presented based on the Bayesian SVR models to estimate large and small failure probability of complex structure with limited model evaluations respectively. Four benchmark examples are employed to validate the performance of the presented method.

AB  - The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is one of the most studied combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, we present the new idea of combining the imperial competitive algorithm with a policy-learning function for solving the TSP problems. All offspring of each country are defined as representing feasible solutions for the TSP. All countries can grow increasingly strong by learning the effective policies of strong countries. Weak countries will generate increasingly excellent offspring by learning the policies of strong countries while retaining the characteristics of their own country. Imitating these policies will enable the weak countries to produce improved offspring; the solutions generated will, therefore, acquire a favorable scheme while maintaining diversity. Finally, experimental results for TSP instances from the TSP library have shown that our proposed algorithm can determine the salesman's tour with more effective performance levels than other known methods.

AB  - Structural reliability analysis is essential for evaluating system failure probabilities under uncertainties, yet it often faces computational efficiency challenges. While surrogate model-based techniques, including Kriging, are known for their high accuracy and efficiency, they typically employ a sequential learning strategy, which limits their potential for parallel computation. This article introduces the Local Penalization Adaptive Learning (LP-AL) method, which facilitates parallel adaptive reliability analysis; LP-AL introduces a penalty function that emulates the process of sequential learning strategies, thereby achieving parallelization. The method also integrates a global error-based stopping criterion and a sample pool reduction strategy to enhance efficiency. We tested LP-AL with five commonly used learning functions across various engineering scenarios. The results demonstrate that LP-AL achieves high accuracy and significantly reduces computational costs, making it a viable approach for diverse structural reliability analysis tasks.

AB  - In this work, an improved active kriging method based on the AK-IS and truncated importance sampling (TIS) method is proposed to efficiently evaluate structural reliability. The novel method called AWK-TIS is inspired by AK-IS and RBF-GA previously published in the literature. The innovation of the AWK-TIS is that TIS is adopted to lessen the sample pool size significantly, and the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is employed to acquire the optimal Kriging model and the most probable point (MPP). To verify the performance of the AWK-TIS method for structural reliability, four numerical cases which are utilized as benchmarks in literature and one real engineering problem about a jet van manipulate mechanism are tested. The results indicate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.

AB  - The pivotal problem in reliability analysis is how to use as few actual assessments as possible to obtain an accurate failure probability. Although adaptive Kriging provides a viable method to address this problem, unsatisfied Kriging surrogate accuracy and reliability modeling samples often lead to an unacceptable computing burden. In this paper, an adaptive optimized Kriging combining efficient sampling (AOK-ES) is proposed: first, to enhance the Kriging approximation ability, a high-fidelity optimized Kriging model (OKM) is established; further, to ensure the samples quality of OKM modeling and reliability calculation, an improved Latin hypercube sampling method and an optimized importance sampling approach are developed correspondingly. Six different types of case studies demonstrate the superiority of the proposed AOK-ES. The analysis results demonstrate that the proposed AOK-ES holds the potential to reduce computing cost while ensuring accuracy.

AB  - In practice, new data are constantly generated, and the existing data complexity algorithms are based on the idea of batch learning. In the face of the dynamic increase of data scale, how to measure the characteristic information of data has become an urgent problem to be solved in the field of data mining. This paper focuses on this problem and further studies its incremental learning function on the basis of in-depth discussion of data complexity proposed by TK Ho et al. Among them, N3 and N4 are the complexity indexes based on KNN classifier (K=1). In this paper, the incremental learning algorithm I1NN was proposed on the basis of 1-NN classifier, and its feasibility and validity were verified on both the artificial data set and the UCI public data set.

AB  - Employing the kinetic theory, we investigate the mutual role of knowledge accumulation and individual wealth growth. For the accumulation of individual knowledge, we introduce a learning function with the spirit of prospect theory to describe the microscopic variation of agents' knowledge and develop a kinetic model of knowledge evolution. Considering the wealth depending on knowledge and their mutual dependence, we construct a joint evolutionary model of knowledge and individual wealth. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that if knowledge reduces the risk of individual wealth growth or increases the wealth of low-wealth groups, wealth inequality decreases. In the case that the wealthy have more opportunities to choose good educational environment to learn knowledge, both knowledge and wealth inequality increase. When considering the government or state educational input, the inequality of knowledge and wealth decreases.

The design integrates Model Reference Control (MRC) and Iterative Learning Control (ILC) in order to achieve the desired objective. The use of MRC makes tracking any reference signal is possible, while ILC is used to eliminate the periodic disturbance. The proposed design is simulated on LTI system with repetitive output disturbance. Model reference learning control with several ILC learning gains are simulated. It is shown that ILC learning gain can be tuned to determine the convergence rate and stability of the whole system. Simulation results indicate that the accurate tracking of aperiodic reference can be achieved as long as the plant and disturbance models are accurately known.

The model is described by 9 elements, including the space set, the action set, the bionic learning function and the system entropy etc. To describe the learning mechanism which is the core of the model, a new notion "negative ideal degree"(NID) is defined. We also prove the convergence of OCLM to indicate that the model is a self-organization system. OCLM has been applied to simulating the Skinner rat experiment. The results show that this model can well simulate the animal's operant conditioning behavior, acquire the cognitive skills through the interaction with the environment and achieve self-learning and self-adaptability.

AB  - A fuzzy controller is suited to control Antilock Brake System (ABS) however time complexity of fuzzy controller is high order. Problem Solution Data Structure (PSDS) has been introduced as a data-oriented model of fuzzy controller to reduce the response time. Locally learning of PSDS controller has been left as an open issue. Fuzzy Learning Mechanism (FLM) has been introduced by using fuzzy inference as learning function, but it needs considerable long process time and steady state errors. In this paper an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) Learning Mechanism (ALM) to learn PSDS is presented. The simulation results show better performance of ALM PSDS comparing to FLM PSDS controller in terms of slip ratio control, stop distance, process time and reduction in steady state errors.

One day after the MPTP lesion, the animals received daily injection of DCS or AM, at the dose of 5 and 10 mg/kg/day. A battery of behavioral test was performed to elucidate motor, cognitive, emotional, and learning function in the mice. MPTP caused a motor impairment, which reversed spontaneously to control levels 10 days after the lesion. However anxiety-like and learning behaviors were not affected by MPTP lesion. Object recognition was suppressed by MPTP, which was ameliorated by the treatment of DCS and AM at the dosage of 10 mg/kg/day. These results suggest that DCS may have beneficial effects on dementia associated with PD.

AB  - An ability of learning for AND/OR operators is discussed here to overcome a drawback of fuzzy ID3. In the fuzzy ID3, it is nearly impossible to obtain the most suitable fuzzy rules since the fuzzy ID3 has a couple of problems, i.e., a problem of a lack of representation and an adjusting problem. In our fuzzy ID3, AND/OR operators are formulated using t-norm and t-conorm connectives with parameters and each parameter is adjusted using golden section method. By using golden section method, we get the optimal solution at a high speed. The proposed fuzzy ID3 gives more accurate fuzzy rules by adjusting parameters. If t-conorm connective is selected as AND/OR operator, the decision tree has more flexible representation.

TI  - Online Diffusion Source Detection in Social Networks
T2  - 2015 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)
CP  - International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)
KW  - SPREAD
AB  - In this paper we study a new problem of online diffusion source detection in social networks. Existing work on diffusion source detection focuses on offline learning, which assumes data collected from network detectors are static and a snapshot of network is available before learning. However, an offline learning model does not meet the needs of early warning, real-time awareness, and real-time response of malicious information spreading in social networks. In this paper, we combine online learning and regression-based detection methods for real-time diffusion source detection. Specifically, we propose a new l(1) non-convex regression model as the learning function, and an Online Stochastic Sub-gradient algorithm (OSS for short). The proposed model is empirically evaluated on both synthetic and real-world networks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

AB  - When human does a decision-making, h/she finally does it using the various functions in the brain. He/she also has the ability to learn to improve the decision and get better results than before. Reinforcement learning, one of machine learning methods, is mimicking of learning function of the biological brain's basal ganglia. In this study, we propose a novel method that combines the conventional reinforcement learning with an emotion model which introduced the concept of biological emotion. Our novel method makes it possible for agent to accomplish complicated tasks which can't be solved by the conventional reinforcement learning method only. Through computer simulations applying the proposed method to path finding problems, it is verified that the proposed method is more effective comparing with the conventional reinforcement learning method.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability in young adults worldwide. TBI-induced long-term cognitive deficits represent a growing clinical problem. Stem cell factor (SCF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) are involved in neuroprotection and neuronal plasticity. However, the knowledge concerning reparative efficacy of SCF + G-CSF treatment in post-acute TBI recovery remains incomplete. This study aims to determine the efficacy of SCF + G-CSF on post-acute TBI recovery in young adult mice. The controlled cortical impact model of TBI was used for inducing a severe damage in the motor cortex of the right hemisphere in 8-week-old male C57BL mice. SCF + G-CSF treatment was initiated 3 weeks after induction of TBI. Severe TBI led to persistent motor functional deficits (Rota-Rod test) and impaired spatial learning function (water maze test). SCF + G-CSF treatment significantly improved the severe TBI-impaired spatial learning function 6 weeks after treatment. TBI also caused significant increases of Fluoro-Jade C positive degenerating neurons in bilateral frontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus, and significant reductions in MAP2(+) apical dendrites and overgrowth of SMI312+ axons in peri-TBI cavity frontal cortex and in the ipsilateral hippocampal CA1 at 24 weeks post-TBI. SCF + G-CSF treatment significantly reduced TBI-induced neurodegeneration in the contralateral frontal cortex and hippocampal CA1, increased MAP2(+) apical dendrites in the peri-TBI cavity frontal cortex, and prevented TBI-induced axonal overgrowth in both the peri-TBI cavity frontal cortex and ipsilateral hippocampal CA1.These findings reveal a novel pathology of axonal overgrowth after severe TBI and demonstrate a therapeutic potential of SCF + G-CSF in ameliorating severe TBI-induced long-term neuronal pathology, neurostructural network malformation, and impairments in spatial learning.

AB  - Recent trends in Artificial Intelligence based softwares have a strong link up with learning. Probabilistic graphical models have been used over the years for solving problems under uncertainty. In this paper, an automobile diagnosis system is proposed to predict the root reason for a faulty part inside a car engine. The system combines Conditional Probabilistic Distributions (CPDs) from the expert as well as those learnt from the user using a Bayesian estimator. In this regard, a learning function is incorporated to combine the CPDs in terms of weighted mean. These combined CPDs are then modeled by a Bayesian Network that is traversed to return a probabilistic solution according to the symptoms given by the user. The Variable elimination algorithm is used for inference. In this regard, several variable ordering heuristics have been evaluated and compared in terms of time efficiency.

TI  - Breaking the Deadly Triad with a Target Network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING, VOL 139
CP  - International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)
AB  - The deadly triad refers to the instability of a reinforcement learning algorithm when it employs off-policy learning, function approximation, and bootstrapping simultaneously. In this paper, we investigate the target network as a tool for breaking the deadly triad, providing theoretical support for the conventional wisdom that a target network stabilizes training We first propose and analyze a novel target network update rule which augments the commonly used Polyak-averaging style update with two projections. We then apply the target network and ridge regularization in several divergent algorithms and show their convergence to regularized TD fixed points. Those algorithms are off-policy with linear function approximation and bootstrapping, spanning both policy evaluation and control, as well as both discounted and average-reward settings. In particular, we provide the first convergent linear Q-learning algorithms under nonrestrictive and changing behavior policies without bi-level optimization.

AB  - Parameter estimation in models of dynamic systems is a common preliminary procedure in control, monitoring, fault detection and diagnosis. A range of tools to fulfill this task has been constantly expanded with new additions to meet the increasing demands of modern technological processes. This article proposes the use of Bayesian networks to estimate the parameters of linear dynamic systems described by a state-space model. The proposed approach is used for system identification of two simulated dynamic systems. The parameters are estimated using a learning function for Bayesian networks from Bayes Net Toolbox for Matlab. The results indicate that Bayesian networks can be used as a system identification tool that can compete with conventional methods. However, the approach requires further research aiming to increase convergence of estimates and eliminate numerical problems.

AB  - This paper presents a new adaptive segmentation of continuous state space based on vector quantization algorithm such as LBG (Linde-Buzo-Gray) for high-dimensional continuous state spaces. The objective of adaptive state space partitioning is to develop the efficiency of learning reward values with an accumulation of state transition vector (STV) in a single-agent environment. We constructed our single-agent model in continuous state and discrete actions spaces using Q-learning function. Moreover, the study of the resulting state space partition reveals in a Voronoi tessellation. In addition, the experimental results show that this proposed method can partition the continuous state space appropriately into Voronoi regions according to not only the number of actions, and achieve a good performance of reward based learning tasks compared with other approaches such as square partition lattice.

AB  - This publication presents a system for integrating machine learning and artificial intelligence solutions with building automation systems. The platform is based on cloud solutions and can integrate with one of the most popular virtual building management solutions, HomeAssistant. The System uses communication based on the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. The example machine learning function described in this publication detects anomalies in the electricity waveforms and raises the alarm. This information determines power quality and detects system faults or unusual power consumption. Recently, increasing electricity prices on global markets have meant that buildings must significantly reduce consumption. Therefore, a fundamental element of energy consumption diagnostics requires detecting unusual forms of energy consumption to optimise the use of individual devices in home and office installations.

AB  - The mathematical model for online controlling hot rolled steel cooling on run-out table (ROT for abbreviation) was analyzed, and water cooling is found to be the main cooling mode for hot rolled steel. The calculation of the drop in strip temperature by both water cooling and air cooling is summed up to obtain the change of heat transfer coefficient. It is found that the learning coefficient of heat transfer coefficient is the kernel coefficient of coiler temperature control (CTC) model tuning. To decrease the deviation between the calculated steel temperature and the measured one at coiler entrance, a laminar cooling control self-learning strategy is used. Using the data acquired in the field, the results of the self-learning model used in the field were analyzed. The analyzed results show that the self-learning function is effective.

A topic (i.e., a list of data values and corresponding appearance probabilities) estimated by LDA can be used as a recommendation that indicates latent data association of co-occurrences in a complex network structure. Results of experiments using random data demonstrated that a latent data association with a signal strength of 0.20 (Jaccard coefficient) can be detected over noise with a strength of up to 0.24. The detected recommendation potentially can help the user to create a hypothesis of a useful pattern in big data.

AB  - Neuroprostheses could potentially recover functions lost due to neural damage. Typical neuroprostheses connect an intact brain with the external environment, thus replacing damaged sensory or motor pathways. Recently, closed-loop neuroprostheses, bidirectionally interfaced with the brain, have begun to emerge, offering an opportunity to substitute malfunctioning brain structures. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate a neuro-inspired model-based approach to neuroprostheses. A VLSI chip was designed to implement essential cerebellar synaptic plasticity rules, and was interfaced with cerebellar input and output nuclei in real time, thus reproducing cerebellum-dependent learning in anesthetized rats. Such a model-based approach does not require prior system identification, allowing for de novo experience-based learning in the brain-chip hybrid, with potential clinical advantages and limitations when compared to existing parametric "black box'' models.

AB  - With increasing design complexity and reliability requirement, performance failure has become a main threat for a robust circuit design. The major challenge to develop a high-sigma yield analysis method is "Curse of Dimensionality". In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Low-Rank Tensor Approximation (Adaptive LRTA) method. It starts with a Latin Hypercube Sampling set to build the initial LRTA meta-model. Our adaptive framework has multiple iterations of meta-model refinement. In each iteration, we evaluate the confidence interval by constructing a set of bootstrap resampled LRTA metamodels, and develop a learning function which determines our experimental design enrichment criteria. The experiment results on high-dimensional SRAM column validate that our method has better efficiency and higher accuracy. Our adaptive LRTA uses 2-6X fewer samples than state-of-the-art methods without compromising accuracy.

AB  - The task of Chinese text spam detection is very challenging due to both glyph and phonetic variations of Chinese characters. This paper proposes a novel framework to jointly model Chinese variational, semantic, and contextualized representations for Chinese text spam detection task. In particular, a Variation Family-enhanced Graph Embedding (VFGE) algorithm is designed based on a Chinese character variation graph. The VFGE can learn both the graph embeddings of the Chinese characters (local) and the latent variation families (global). Furthermore, an enhanced bidirectional language model, with a combination gate function and an aggregation learning function, is proposed to integrate the graph and text information while capturing the sequential information. Extensive experiments have been conducted on both SMS and review datasets, to show the proposed method outperforms a series of state-of-the-art models for Chinese spam detection.

AB  - The possibility of applying genetic algorithms to configure a topology of artificial neural network which process a multisensor array vector signal for gas-analytical tasks has been considered. Such a configuration is implemented according to the criteria of increasing the percentage of correct recognition and reducing the computing cost by using a set of predefined possible values of the parameters of the neural network architecture. The optimized characteristics are the number of hidden layers of neurons in each layer and the amount of training sampling. The tests have been performed in the (c) Matlab neural network operated under Levenberg-Marquardt back-propagation learning function. The obtained results confirm the efficiency of the genetic algorithm to optimize the topology of designed artificial neural network with advanced characteristics.

AB  - An important aspect of cognitive control is the ability to appropriately select, update, and maintain contextual information related to behavioral goals, and to use this information to coordinate processing over extended periods. In our novel, neurobiologically based, connectionist computational model, the selection, updating, and maintenance of context occur through interactions between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dopamine (DA) neurotransmitter system. Phasic DA activity serves two simultaneous and synergistic functions: (1) a gating function, which regulates the access of information to active memory mechanisms subserved by PFC; and (2) a learning function, which allows the system to discover what information is relevant for selection as context.

AB  - This paper proposes a rapid detection method for the center of gravity based on a neural network model. It is suitable for the rapid response requirement such as attitude control of a gait robot or real time torque control of a running car. The proposed method detects the center of gravity position on a straight line by using only the hardware circuit composing of common electronic devices instead of software, microprocessor and AD converter.
   The circuit employs some neural based comparators without the learning function to simplify the circuit structure. The detection circuit using some parallel processing neural comparators rapidly detects the center of gravity position on a straight line. In this paper, the circuit is designed and fabricated with electronic devices, and the circuit experiment shows the performance of the position detection.

AB  - In a neural network, neuron computation is achieved through the summation of input signals fed by synaptic connections. The synaptic activity (weight) is dictated by the synchronous firing of neurons, inducing potentiation/depression of the synaptic connection. This learning function can be supported by the resistive switching memory (RRAM), which changes its resistance depending on the amplitude, the pulse width and the bias polarity of the applied signal. This work shows a new synapse circuit comprising a MOS transistor as a selector and a RRAM as a variable resistance, displaying spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) similar to the one originally experienced in biological neural networks. We demonstrate long-term potentiation and long-term depression by simulations with an analytical model of resistive switching. Finally, the experimental demonstration of the new STDP scheme is presented.

AB  - Even though the neurons in the human brain are sensitive to noises, human central nervous systems can operate correctly under a noisy environment. Since neural networks have superior information processing functions, many investigators have attemptted to model biological neurons and neural networks. A number of recent studies of neural networks have been conducted with the purpose of applying engineering to the brain. Especially, neuro devices have been created that focus on how to have a learning function. Here, we focus on spike timing dependent synaptic plasticity (STDP) and construct pulse-type neuro devices with STDP using analog VLSI technology. We show that it is possible to extract phase differences representing the reinforcement part of the synaptic weight by using pulse-type neuro devices with STDP. Moreover, we investigate noise tolerance for thermal noise and fluctuation of time.

AB  - Two-stage three-machine assembly flow shop, multiple-agent scheduling problems, and scheduling models with time-dependent processing times have been separately receiving continuous attention on research community. All the three phenomena have been shown to exist in many real applications, but no study has so far integrated the two-stage assembly flow shop, two-agent, and time-dependent processing times simultaneously. In view of this lack of integrated study, we investigated a two-stage three-machine assembly flow shop scheduling problem with both two-agent and learning phenomenon. Our objective was minimizing the total completion time of the first agent's jobs subject to a given upper bound imposed on the total completion time of the second agent's jobs. To solve the problem, some dominant propositions and three lower bounds were first derived to be used in the branch-and-bound algorithm for the small-size jobs. Then, four versions of hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithms were proposed to find approximate solutions for small-size and big-size jobs, respectively.

AB  - Memristors, acting as artificial synapses, have promised their prospects in neuromorphic systems that imitate the brain's computing paradigm. However, most studies focused on the understanding of the memristive mechanism and how to optimize the synaptic performance, and the implementations of higher-order cognitive functions are quite limited. Here the experimental demonstration of a representative network level learning function, i.e., associative learning and extinction, in a compact memristive neuromorphic circuit with only one memristor is reported. The association of the conditioned and unconditioned stimulus is established within a temporal window through the spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule, whereas the extinction of the formed memory is due to the synaptic depression. The temporal contiguity consists with biological behaviors and reflects nature's cause and effect rule. An efficient methodology of integrating memristors into large-scale neuromorphic systems for massively parallel computing, such as pattern recognition, is provided herein.

AB  - Deep learning models find an increasing application in the diagnosis of brain disorders. Designed for large scale datasets, deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve state-of-the-art classification performance on a number of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. While utilizing DNNs might improve the performance, the complexity of the learning function decreases the interpretability of the model. Moreover, DNNs require considerably more time to train compared to their linear predecessors. In this paper, we re-examine the use of deep graph neural networks for graph-based disease prediction in favor of simpler linear models. We present a simplified linear model, which is more than 10 times faster to train than the previous DNN counterparts. We test our model on three fMRI datasets and show that it achieves comparable or superior performance to the state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - In this paper, according to the Kriging based reliability analysis method, an efficient se-quential sampling method combined with radial basis function is proposed to reduce the modeling complexity of the surrogate model and eliminate the uncertainties of the Kriging itself on the reliability analysis results. A novel active learning function is developed that can search for the sequential samples effectively among the candidate set. For terminating the sequential sampling process, a corresponding convergence criterion according to the failure probability obtained from the cross-validation method is constructed. Furthermore, the proposed method can be applied to any other surrogate model in principle. Five numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method has high precision and efficiency as well as strong applicability in structural reliability analysis. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This paper introduces a two-stage assembly flowshop scheduling model with time cumulated learning effect, which exists in many realistic scheduling settings. By the time cumulated learning effect, we mean that the actual job processing time of a job depends on its scheduled position as well as the processing times of the jobs already processed. The first stage consists of two independently working machines where each machine produces its own component. The second stage consists of a single assembly machine. The objective is to identify a schedule that minimizes the total completion time of all jobs. With analysis on the discussed problem, some dominance rules are developed to optimize the solving procedure. Incorporating with the developed dominance rules, a dominance rule and opposition-based particle swarm optimization algorithm (DR-OPSO) and branch-and-bound are devised. Computational experiments have been conducted to compare the performances of the proposed DR-OPSO and branch-and-bound through comparing with the standard O-PSO and PSO. The results fully demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed DR-OPSO algorithm, providing references to the relevant decision-makers in practice.

AB  - Analog DNA strand displacement circuits can be used to build artificial neural network due to the continuity of dynamic behavior. In this study, DNA implementations of novel catalysis, novel degradation and adjustment reaction modules are designed and used to build an analog DNA strand displacement reaction network. A novel adaptive linear neuron (ADALINE) is constructed by the ordinary differential equations of an ideal formal chemical reaction network, which is built by reaction modules. When reaction network approaches equilibrium, the weights of the ADALINE are updated without learning algorithm. Simulation results indicate that, ADALINE based on the analog DNA strand displacement circuit has ability to implement the learning function of the ADALINE based on the ideal formal chemical reaction networks, and fit a class of linear function.

KW  - PHYSICS
AB  - Many physical and social systems are best described by networks. And the structural properties of these networks often critically determine the properties and function of the resulting mathematical models. An important method to infer the correlations between topology and function is the detection of community structure, which plays a key role in the analysis, design, and optimization of many complex systems. The nonnegative matrix factorization has been used prolifically to that effect in recent years, although it cannot guarantee balanced partitions, and it also does not allow a proactive computation of the number of communities in a network. This indicates that the nonnegative matrix factorization does not satisfy all the nonnegative low-rank approximation conditions. Here we show how to resolve this important open problem by optimizing the identifiability of community structure. We propose a new form of nonnegative matrix decomposition and a probabilistic surrogate learning function that can be solved according to the majorization-minimization principle. Extensivein silicotests on artificial and real-world data demonstrate the efficient performance in community detection, regardless of the size and complexity of the network.

AB  - The crucial part of decision-making in a two-echelon supply chain modelling is to decide the production quantity of the manufacturer to satisfy the demand of the retailers. In this paper, we develop a two-echelon supply chain model with one manufacturer and multiple retailers. The production quantity of the manufacturer and demand of each retailer are the uncertain components of the model, and they are quantified by fuzzy numbers. Wright's learning function is applied in the fuzzy limits to appertain the knowledge acquired through experience of supply chain leaders in decision-making. We determine the optimal order quantity of each retailer by calculus method. An approximate value of generalised harmonic numbers is employed for the derivation of optimal values in learning model. Numerical examples are supplied to demonstrate both fuzzy and learning models. The robustness of the learning model is explained using numerical examples and comparative study.

AB  - Against the background of globalization, the trend of corporate social responsibility is irreversible. In this study, a motivation analysis framework and evaluation index system of corporate social responsibility under dual constraints are established and an index system of corporate social responsibility evaluation is designed. A multiple linear regression analysis is used to build an evaluation index system model of cement enterprises' corporate social responsibility accounting. To further improve the fidelity between this model and the actual situation of cement enterprises, a self-adaptive Service-Oriented Architecture reasoning system, constructed by integrating the reasoning function of Service-Orientated Architecture logic and the learning function of the neural network, improves the evaluation index system model of the social responsibility accounting of enter-prises. Through experimental analysis, the error of the corporate social responsibility accounting evaluation index in this study was within 10 %, indicating a good prediction effect. According to this set of standards, enterprises must fulfill their social responsibilities to be helpful in the future development of corporate social responsibility evaluations.

AB  - This study introduces a reliability analysis methodology employing Kriging modeling enriched by a hybrid active learning process. Emphasizing noise integration into structural response predictions, this research presents a framework that combines Kriging modeling with regression to handle noisy data. The framework accommodates either constant variance of noise for all observed responses or varying, uncorrelated noise variances. Hyperparameters and the variance of the Kriging model with noisy data are determined through maximum likelihood estimation to address inherent uncertainties in structural predictions. An adaptive hybrid learning function guides design of experiment (DoE) point identification through an iterative enrichment process. This function strategically targets points near the limit-state approximation, farthest from existing training points, and explores candidate points to maximize the probability of misclassification. The framework's application is demonstrated through metamodel-based reliability analysis for continuum and discrete structures with relatively large degrees of freedom, employing subset simulations. Numerical examples validate the framework's effectiveness, highlighting its potential for accurate and efficient reliability assessments in complex structural systems.

TI  - Bayesian Support Vector Regression for Reliability-Based Design Optimization
T2  - AIAA JOURNAL
KW  - SPACE
AB  - Solving reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) by combining surrogate models is a powerful tool to deal with the output variation induced by uncertainties during actual engineering design. This paper aims to develop a strategy for solving RBDO problems by support vector regression (SVR) under the Bayesian inference, referred to as Bayesian SVR (BSVR). The BSVR model possesses the features of original SVR as well as providing the prediction variance to direct the sequential sampling process for probabilistic analysis in RBDO. In the meanwhile, a learning function combined with the sample pool truncation strategy is proposed to select the new training samples to adaptively update the BSVR model, which can accurately and efficiently approximate the important probabilistic constraint boundaries in the desired regions, and the newly selected training samples tend to be far away from the existing training points under the current design to avoid clustering. The computational capability and the good engineering applicability of the proposed method are verified by three numerical examples and two engineering applications about a stiffened rib of the wing edge and a latch-lock mechanism of the cabin hatch.

AB  - The surrogate models-based prediction of performance functions is an efficient and accurate methodology in structural reliability analyses. In this paper, the M5 model tree (M5Tree) is improved based on radial basis training data set and it is named as Radial basis M5Tree (RM5Tree). To predict the performance function, the random input variables are transferred from ordinal space to radial space using several effective points for nonlinear calibrated model of RM5Tree. The input datasets are controlled using the radial dataset for high dimensional reliability problems to reduce computational efforts to evaluate the performance function. The abilities of RM5Tree using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) with respect to accuracy and efficiency are investigated through five nonlinear reliability problems. The results indicate that the proposed RM5Tree performs superior manner in accuracy and efficiency compared to the M5Tree, response surface method (RSM) and first order reliability method.

AB  - The need for more resilient infrastructures entails an accurate and efficient structural reliability analysis. In recent years, Kriging-based meta-modeling has constantly been adopted to reduce the computational cost in estimating the probability of failure. Active learning models focus on most informative samples to increase computational efficiency. Nevertheless, the efficiency gained from the models may diminish when dealing with a rare event with a relatively small probability of failure. To resolve the difficulty, this study proposes a new method, Adaptive Kriging with Multi-layered Hyperball-based Importance Sampling (AK-MHIS), to estimate the structural probability of failure. AK-MHIS uses an adaptive multi-layered hyperball as its candidate sample pool with a new sample filtering mechanism and a more robust stopping condition for the active-learning phase. The performance of AK-MHIS method is validated in benchmark cases. The verification results confirm the superior performance of AK-MHIS to previous methods.

AB  - This paper presents a robust method for rare event probability estimation in highly nonlinear systems. Utilizing a nearest-neighbor approximation of the true performance function and an adaptively extended experimental design, we introduce a simple yet effective active learning function. This function dynamically balances global exploration and local exploitation through sequential adaptive selection of points from the input domain. The resulting surrogate model, refined based on distances, serves the dual purpose of estimating failure probability and selecting optimal candidates for further model evaluations. Our adaptive design supports accurate real-time estimation of failure probability and failure probability sensitivity to individual variables, especially in cases of non-smooth or highly nonlinear functions. Even in scenarios with smooth functions, our method outperforms existing approaches utilizing the function gradients in estimation accuracy for a given computational budget. The adaptively constructed surrogate model excels in handling intricate failure surfaces, multiple design points, and systems with bifurcations. This approach is particularly suitable for random vectors with small to moderate dimensions.

AB  - Metamodels in lieu of time-demanding performance functions can accelerate the reliability analysis effectively. In this paper, we propose an efficient collaborative active learning strategy-based augmented radial basis function metamodel (CAL-ARBF), for reliability analysis with implicit and nonlinear performance functions. For generating the suitable samples, a CAL function is first designed to constrain the new samples being generated in sensitivity region, near limit state surface and keep certain distances mutually. Then by adjusting the adjustment coefficient of CAL function, the CAL-ARBF is mathematically modeled and the corresponding reliability analysis theory is developed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by four numerical samples, including global nonlinear problem, local nonlinear problem, nonlinear oscillator and truss structure. Through comparison of several state-of-the-art methods, the proposed CAL-ARBF is demonstrated to possess the computational advantages in efficiency and accuracy for reliability analysis.

AB  - Profust reliability analysis, in which the failure state of a load-bearing structure is assumed to be fuzzy, is investigated in this paper. A novel active learning method based on the Kriging model is proposed to minimize the number of function evaluations. The new method is termed ALK-Pfst. The sign of performance function at a given random threshold determines the profust failure probability. Therefore, the expected risk function at an arbitrary threshold is derived as the learning function of ALK-Pfst. By making full use of the prediction information of Kriging model, the prediction error of profust failure probability is carefully derived into a closed-form expression. Aided by the prediction error, the accuracy of Kriging model during the learning process can be monitored in real time. As a result, the learning process can be timely terminated with little loss of accuracy. Four examples are provided to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.

AB  - Recently, scheduling with learning effects has received growing attention. A well-known learning model is called 'sum-of processing-times-based learning' where the actual processing time of a job is a non-increasing function of the jobs already processed. However, the actual processing time of a given job drops to zero precipitously when the normal job processing times are large. Motivated by this observation, this paper develops a truncated learning model in which the actual job processing time not only depends on the processing times of the jobs already processed but also depends on a control parameter. The use of the truncated function is to model the phenomenon that the learning of a human activity is limited. In this paper, some single-machine scheduling problems can be solved in polynomial time. Besides, the error bounds are also provided for the problems to minimise the maximum lateness and the total weighted completion time.

AB  - Conducting reliability analysis on complex systems, particularly those characterized by minimal failure probabilities and computationally intensive models, presents significant challenges. This article introduces a reliability analysis method combining the adaptive augmented radial basis function and the dynamic importance sampling (ARBF-DIS) algorithm. This method improves the generalization capacity of the augmented radial basis function at both local and global scales through the application of an anisotropic technique and orthogonal conditions. By using efficient cross-validation, the methodology facilitates the training of the metamodel, enabling it to provide predictive variance essential for constructing an adaptive sampling learning function. A key aspect of this approach is its capability to address the issue of low failure probabilities through dynamic importance sampling, which involves calculating an optimal importance sampling function derived from the current metamodel. The effectiveness and precision of the ARBF-DIS method are demonstrated through two analytical examples and a solid rocket motor reliability problem.

AB  - In recent years, an active learning method combining Kriging and Monte Carlo Simulation (AK-MCS), has been developed for calculating the failure probability. However, the original AK-MCS only uses serial computing, which limits its ability to take advantage of distributed computing. Thus, this work introduces a novel adaptive learning approach for reliability analysis by combining local optimization and a parallelization strategy. The new approach identifies the points of greatest uncertainty through local optimization and adds them into the design of experiments. An inner learning loop is implemented, searching for additional best points with a pseudo Kriging model so that the performance function can be evaluated in parallel. Furthermore, an adaptive strategy is proposed to determine the amount of additional points during iteration based on the minimum value of the learning function. We conducted a comparison between the proposed method and the original AK-MCS as well as a few additional methods in order to assess its efficacy and precision. Five examples were considered to assess performance.

AB  - This paper proposes a time-variant reliability method for an industrial robot rotate vector (RV) reducer with multiple failure modes using a Kriging model. Firstly, the limit state functions of the industrial robot RV reducer are built by considering time-variant load and material degradation based on the failure physic method. Secondly, a time-variant reliability analysis method for multiple failure modes is proposed based on a double-loop Kriging model. The inner loop is the extremal optimization for each limit state function based on the efficient global optimization (EGO). The outer loop is the active learning reliability analysis by combining multiple response Gaussian process model (MRGP) and the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). Furthermore, three learning functions (U-function, EFF-function and H-function) are individually adopted to choose a new sample point until the convergence is satisfied. Case studies are finally provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Fatigue reliability analysis for a high temperature component is a complex task due to the difficulties of doing experiments and uncertainties occurring in practical engineering. Researchers usually focus on the fatigue life scatter of standard specimens since the life data are easily available from fatigue tests. An alternative method is proposed in this paper which can replace the real tests of high temperature components with finite element (FE) simulation. A constitutive model coupled damage rule is utilized in this work to describe the cyclic stress-strain response. Then, the FE simulations is incorporated into the general framework for reliability assessment. An adaptive least squares support vector machines with Latin hypercube sampling and learning function is employed to construct limit state function. To verify the accuracy and robustness of proposed method, a numerical example is utilized. In the end of this paper, a three-layer structure extrusion container is applied for whole flowchart of fatigue reliability analysis.

AB  - To carry out the reliability analysis, whose performance functions are presented in a nonlinear form, many studies propose the reliability analysis methods involving the active Kriging model. Though some learning functions have been developed to refine the Kriging model around the limit state surface (LSS) effectively, most of them rely on the Kriging predictor and its variance. In this research, a new learning function, formed by the combination of the conditional likelihood function and clustering constrain function through adaptive weight coefficient, is raised to reconstruct Kriging by the candidate samples near the LSS. With the conditional likelihood function, the likelihood that the Kriging predictor reaches the LSS mainly contributes to the selection of the best next point. Three numerical applications with different complexities are used to investigate the validity of the proposed reliability method. In addition, the performance of the proposed reliability method is tested by an engineering application.

AB  - Introducing recent advances in the machine learning techniques to state-of-the-art discrete choice models, we develop an approach to infer the unique and complex decision making process of a decision-maker (DM), which is characterized by the DM's priorities and attitudinal character, along with the attributes interaction, to name a few. On the basis of exemplary preference information in the form of pairwise comparisons of alternatives, our method seeks to induce a DM's preference model in terms of the parameters of recent discrete choice models. To this end, we reduce our learning function to a constrained non-linear optimization problem. Our learning approach is a simple one that takes into consideration the interaction among the attributes along with the priorities and the unique attitudinal character of a DM. The experimental results on standard benchmark datasets suggest that our approach is not only intuitively appealing and easily interpretable but also competitive to state-of-the-art methods.

However, the actual processing time of a given job drops to zero precipitously as the number of jobs increases.

In addition, we further analyse the worst-case error bounds for the problems to minimize the total weighted completion time, discounted total weighted completion time and maximum lateness.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a new mathematical programming model to tackle the multi-skilled project scheduling problem. Considering the effect of learning and forgetting on the human skills, an exponential learning function has been developed by assuming the efficiency of employees performing activities to be dynamic. Taking the nonlinearity of the function into account, we use separable programming to acquire an appropriate linear approximation for it. Moreover, the proposed model allows us to relax some of the binary variables linearly without any modifications. At the end, the final model is tested with some instances and is solved by CPLEX in order to confirm the implemented simplifications and linear approximation. After examination of the results and checking the constraints, the validity of the model and its modifications have been approved. Regarding NP-hardness of the MSPSP, this process can be a prominent step for developing metaheuristic algorithms to solve real world problems.

AB  - Training transformers models on biomedical data has shown promising results. However, these language models require fine-tuning large models on very specific supervised data for each task. In this paper, we propose to use siamese neural models (sentence transformers) that embed texts to be compared in a vector space, and apply them to the biomedical domain on three main tasks: classification, question answering and retrieval. Training is based on articles from the MEDLINE bibliographic database associated with their MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) keywords and optimizes an objective self-supervised contrastive learning function. The representation of the texts (embeddings) obtained by our siamese models can be stored, indexed and used with transfer learning without needing the language models. The obtained results on several benchmarks show that the proposed models can solve these tasks with results comparable to biomedical cross-encoders transformers and offer a several advantages by being flexible and efficient at inference time.

AB  - We propose a comprehensive profit -sensitive approach for credit risk modeling in P2P lending for small businesses, one of the most financially complex segments. We go beyond traditional and cost-sensitive approaches by including the financial costs and incomes through profits and introducing the profit information at three points of the modeling process: the estimation of the learning function of the classification algorithm (XGBoost in our case), the hyperparameter optimization, and the decision function. The profit -sensitive approaches achieve a higher level of profitability than the profit-insensitive approach in the small business case analyzed by granting mostly lower-risk, lower-amount loans. Explainability tools help us to discover the key features of such loans. Our proposal can be extended to other loan markets or other classification problems as long as the cells of the misclassification matrix have an economic value.

AB  - Machine learning techniques have received much attention in many areas for regression and classification tasks. In this paper, two new support vector regression (SVR) models, namely, least-square SVR and e-SVR, are developed under the Bayesian inference framework with a square loss function and a e-insensitive squared one respectively. In this framework, a Gaussian process prior is assigned to the regression function, and maximum posterior estimate of this function results in a support vector regression problem. The proposed method provides point-wise probabilistic prediction while keeps the structural risk minimization principle, and it allows us to determine the optimal hyper-parameters by maximizing Bayesian model evidence. Based on the Bayesian SVR model, an active learning algorithm is developed, and new training points are selected adaptively based on a learning function to update the SVR model progressively. Numerical results reveal that the developed two Bayesian SVR models are very promising for constructing accurate regression model for problems with diverse characteristics, especially for medium and high dimensional problems.

AB  - In this study, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model that can predict future team rankings in male volleyball professional league was developed. Data used to develop the ANN model were obtained from 2013 to 2015 league tables. Wins, defeats, home wins, and away wins were used as input parameters and team rankings as an output parameter. There are only a few studies about predicting the match results using the ANN method. Related studies are mostly based on football, basketball and bowl games. There are no studies researching the prediction of team league's rankings in volleyball. This is the first study about team ranking prediction in volleyball by the means of the ANN. The results showed that the most optimal ANN method was a single hidden layer 4-neurone model which had logsig transfer function, trainlm training function, and learngmd adaptive learning function. The accuracy rate of the most optimal model was 98%, meaning that team standing in a league table can be forecasted accurately using this ANN model.

AB  - We report an improvement to the conventional Echo State Network (ESN) across three benchmark chaotic time-series prediction tasks using fruit fly connectome data alone. We also investigate the impact of key connectome-derived structural features on prediction performance - uniquely bridging neurobiological structure and machine learning function; and find that both increasing the global average clustering coefficient and modifying the position of weights - by permuting their synapse-synapse partners - can lead to increased model variance and (in some cases) degraded performance. In all we consider four topological point modifications to a connectome-derived ESN reservoir (null model): namely, we alter the network sparsity, re-draw nonzero weights from a uniform distribution, permute nonzero weight positions, and increase the network global average clustering coefficient. We compare the four resulting ESN model classes and the null model - with a conventional ESN by conducting time-series prediction experiments on size-variants of the MackeyGlass 17 (MG-17), Lorenz, and Rossler chaotic time series; denoting each model's performance and variance across train-validate trials.

AB  - In the more recent days, topics of scheduling reentrant flowshop settings and scheduling models with learning consideration have received growing attention separately in research areas. However, scheduling with both the learning and re-entrant concept is relatively unexplored. Motivated by this limitation, this paper considers re-entrant permutation flowshop scheduling of jobs associated with a sum-of-processing-times-based learning function to minimize the makespan. Because the same problem without learning or re-entrant has been proved NP-hard, we thus propose four heuristics and a simulated annealing (SA) to search for approximate solutions. In the first stage, Johnson's rule (JH) combined with four local search methods, which are namely the NEH method, pairwise interchange (PI), backward-shifted re-insertion (BACK), and forward-shifted re-insertion (FOR), is tackled in this problem. They are referred to the four heuristics as JH + NEH, JH + PI, JH + BACK, and JH + FOR, respectively. In the second stage, a simulated annealing algorithm seeded with four good different initials obtained from the first stage is provided for finding a good quality of solutions. Finally, the experimental results are tested to assess the performances of all the proposed algorithms as job size changes or machine number or learning effect or the number of re-entrant time.

AB  - PurposeAssessing the failure probability of engineering structures is still a challenging task in the presence of various uncertainties due to the involvement of expensive-to-evaluate computational models. The traditional simulation-based approaches require tremendous computational effort, especially when the failure probability is small. Thus, the use of more efficient surrogate modeling techniques to emulate the true performance function has gained increasingly more attention and application in recent years. In this paper, an active learning method based on a Kriging model is proposed to estimate the failure probability with high efficiency and accuracy.Design/methodology/approachTo effectively identify informative samples for the enrichment of the design of experiments, a set of new learning functions is proposed. These learning functions are successfully incorporated into a sampling scheme, where the candidate samples for the enrichment are uniformly distributed in the n-dimensional hypersphere with an iteratively updated radius. To further improve the computational efficiency, a parallelization strategy that enables the proposed algorithm to select multiple sample points in each iteration is presented by introducing the K-means clustering algorithm. Hence, the proposed method is referred to as the adaptive Kriging method based on K-means clustering and sampling in n-Ball (AK-KBn).FindingsThe performance of AK-KBn is evaluated through several numerical examples. According to the generated results, all the proposed learning functions are capable of guiding the search toward sample points close to the LSS in the critical region and result in a converged Kriging model that perfectly matches the true one in the regions of interest. The AK-KBn method is demonstrated to be well suited for structural reliability analysis and a very good performance is observed in the investigated examples.Originality/valueIn this study, the statistical information of Kriging prediction, the relative contribution of the sample points to the failure probability and the distances between the candidate samples and the existing ones are all integrated into the proposed learning functions, which enables effective selection of informative samples for updating the Kriging model. Moreover, the number of required iterations is reduced by introducing the parallel computing strategy, which can dramatically alleviate the computation cost when time demanding numerical models are involved in the analysis.

AB  - The financial sector is faced with fast moving and expansive changes in a dynamic environment and market. This situation is caused by current developments in the finance market, newly emerging competitors and less differentiation amongst existing banking services. However, bank organizations are under high pressure to deal with this increasing and changing competition on the market. Taking a look into future, banks need to tap new respectively further business areas and models, which don't (only) focus on traditional and typical banking services any longer but go beyond. Ultimately, the individual's continuous learning is an essential precondition for the organization's learning and development capability; which also implies handle organizational ambidexterity by adding exploration to exploitation.
   In this regards, bank managers are key persons for the design of learning oriented framework conditions for individual employees and team members at their workplace. Thus, they need to take up an extended leader role and understand themselves as personnel developer. Based on organizational learning theories and the connected field of knowledge management, this demands managers for acting at four design levels, respectively, levels for organizational learning in order to contribute to the organization's enhancement of its learning and innovation ability: At individual level, employees need be encouraged for learning through appropriate workplace infrastructures which allow self-organization. At team level, collaboration and team learning needs to be afforded. At organizational level, generation, usage, sharing knowledge and experiences needs to be ensured, this is connected to supportive cultures, structures and strategies. Finally, openness to the environment is crucial for generating input "from the outside" and developing ideas and, at best, knowledge in collaboration with external actors. From an educational management perspective, we argue that an internal or external learning function can effectively support bank managers in this extended role. Therefore, we follow the research question "how can a learning function support bank managers in designing workplace framework conditions to enable continuous learning of bank employees and teams as precondition for the bank's organizational learning?" and based our empirical examination on case study research.

AB  - Reinforcement learning, as an important direction of machine learning, has huge development potential due to its unsupervised and model-free characteristics. Deep Q-Learning Network(DQN) is a neural network combining Q-learning and deep learning, which can effectively approximate the Q-learning function. This paper proposes a feedforward feedback control system based on the DQN algorithm, which uses the strong generality of reinforcement learning to solve the difficult problem of feedforward controller design for nonlinear systems. A single-loop water tank liquid level control system model is built, and artificial disturbance factors are introduced to check the performance of the control system. Based on the water tank liquid level control, a simulation experiment is designed to compare the feedforward feedback control system based on DQN with a feedback control system with the same parameters. The simulation results show that the feed-forward controller based on DQN can significantly improve the control effect of the control system, verifying the effectiveness of the algorithm.

AB  - In this paper, we propose an analog CMOS circuit which achieves spiking neural networks with spike-timing dependent synaptic plasticity (STDP). In particular, we propose a STDP circuit with symmetric function for the first time, and also we demonstrate associative memory operation in a Hopfield-type feedback network with STDP learning. In our spiking neuron model, analog information expressing processing results is given by the relative timing of spike firing events. It is well known that a biological neuron changes its synaptic weights by STDP, which provides learning rules depending on relative timing between asynchronous spikes. Therefore, STDP can be used for spiking neural systems with learning function. The measurement results of fabricated chips using TSMC 0.25 mu m CMOS process technology demonstrate that our spiking neuron circuit can construct feedback networks and. update synaptic weights based on relative timing between asynchronous spikes by a symmetric or an asymmetric STDP circuits.

AB  - Network intrusion detection plays an important role in network security. With the deepening of machine learning research, especially the generative adversarial networks (GAN) proposal, the stability of the anomaly detector is put forward for higher requirements. The main focus of this paper is on the security of machine learning based anomaly detectors. In order to detect the robustness of the existing advanced anomaly detection algorithm, we propose an anomaly detector attack framework MACGAN (maintain attack features based on the generative adversarial networks). The MACGAN framework consists of two parts. The first part is used to analyze the attack fields manually. Then, the learning function of GAN in the second part is used to bypass the anomaly detection. Our framework is tested on the latest Kitsune2018 and CICIDS2017 data sets. Experimental results demonstrate the ability to bypass the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. This greatly helps the network security researchers to improve the stability of the detector.

AB  - Kriging surrogate model has extracted extensive attention in reliability evaluation, owing to its excellent applicability and operability nowadays, which confronts with difficulties in balancing the efficiency and accuracy for complicated mechanical assets with multiple failure modes. Consequently, this paper devises a multi-performance reliability analysis approach within the surrogate model framework, particularly innovative in its use of cluster mixing weight. Specifically, high-value test points are selected to fit the surrogate model after sorting the samples referring to the corresponding values; then, a cluster-based active learning strategy is employed to accomplish rapid convergence, and the particle swarm algorithm is utilized to optimize relevant parameters. Afterwards, the mixing weight for every performance referring to the contributions to the final reliability is determined, and the failure probability is subsequently predicted. Furthermore, the superiority of the proposed approach with the clustering surrogate model and mixing weight, compared with traditional sampling as well as other surrogate models, has been verified via case studies, contributing to overcoming the multi-performance reliability analysis oriented to complicated mechanical assets.

AB  - In this work, a data-driven indirect iterative learning control (DD-iILC) is presented for a repetitive nonlinear system by taking a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) feedback control in the inner loop. A linear parametric iterative tuning algorithm for the set-point is developed from an ideal nonlinear learning function that exists in theory by utilizing an iterative dynamic linearization (IDL) technique. Then, an adaptive iterative updating strategy of the parameter in the linear parametric set-point iterative tuning law is presented by optimizing an objective function for the controlled system. Since the system considered is nonlinear and nonaffine with no available model information, the IDL technique is also used along with a strategy similar to the parameter adaptive iterative learning law. Finally, the entire DD-iILC scheme is completed by incorporating the local PID controller. The convergence is proved by applying contraction mapping and mathematical induction. The theoretical results are verified by simulations on a numerical example and a permanent magnet linear motor example.

AB  - Current surrogate modeling methods for time-dependent reliability analysis implement a double-loop procedure, with the computation of extreme value response in the outer loop and optimization in the inner loop. The computational effort of the double-loop procedure is quite high even though improvements have been made to improve the efficiency of the inner loop. This paper proposes a single-loop Kriging (SILK) surrogate modeling method for time-dependent reliability analysis. The optimization loop used in current methods is completely removed in the proposed method. A single surrogate model is built for the purpose of time-dependent reliability assessment. Training points of random variables and over time are generated at the same level instead of at two separate levels. The surrogate model is refined adaptively based on a learning function modified from time-independent reliability analysis and a newly developed convergence criterion. Strategies for building the surrogate model are investigated for problems with and without stochastic processes. Results of three numerical examples show that the proposed single-loop procedure significantly increases the efficiency of time-dependent reliability analysis without sacrificing the accuracy.

AB  - Automatic summarization systems provide an effective solution to today?s unprecedented growth of textual data. For real-world tasks, such as data mining and information retrieval, the factual correctness of generated summary is critical. However, existing models usually focus on improving the informativeness rather than optimizing factual correctness. In this work, we present a Fact-Aware Reinforced Abstractive Sentence Summarization framework to improve the factual correctness of neural abstractive summarization models, denoted as FAR-ASS. Specifically, we develop an automatic fact extraction scheme leveraging OpenIE (Open Information Extraction) and dependency parser tools to extract structured fact tuples. Then, to quantitatively evaluate the factual correctness, we define a factual correctness score function that considers the factual accuracy and factual redundancy. We further propose to adopt reinforcement learning to improve readability and factual correctness by jointly optimizing a mixed-objective learning function. We use the English Gigaword and DUC 2004 datasets to evaluate our model. Experimental results show that compared with competitive models, our model significantly improves the factual correctness and readability of generated summaries, and also reduces duplicates while improving the informativeness.

KW  - MODEL
AB  - The aim of the present paper is to develop a strategy for solving reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) problems by sparse polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). Because classic sparse regression methods cannot provide the surrogate error measure that can be employed to improve the sampling performance for failure probability estimation in RBDO, Bayesian compressed sensing with state-of-the-art performance is employed to build sparse PCE in the paper. In the meanwhile, a new active learning function is proposed to adaptively select new training points. Two goals can be achieved using this criterion; that is, most of the selected training points are selected from the desired regions to approximate limit state surfaces, and these points tend to be far away from the existing points in the current design to avoid the clustering problem. Because the sparse PCEs are built in an augmented space, it is made numerically affordable to solve the RBDO problem with no extra computational cost. The computation capability of the proposed method is demonstrated by several analytical RBDO problems. Meanwhile, the design optimization of a stiffened rib of the wing edge in a certain aircraft also verifies its good engineering applicability.

AB  - The low-dimensional manifold hypothesis posits that the data found in many applications, such as those involving natural images, lie (approximately) on low-dimensional manifolds embedded in a high-dimensional Euclidean space. In this setting, a typical neural network defines a function that takes a finite number of vectors in the embedding space as input. However, one often needs to consider evaluating the optimized network at points outside the training distribution. This paper considers the case in which the training data are distributed in a linear subspace of R-d. We derive estimates on the variation of the learning function, defined by a neural network, in the direction transversal to the subspace. We study the potential regularization effects associated with the network's depth and noise in the codimension of the data manifold. We also present additional side effects in training due to the presence of noise.

AB  - Reliability analysis and design optimization of structures have been gaining a significant amount of attention in recent decades. Most of the current studies are based on linear structural analysis. The study on reliability analysis and design optimization for nonlinear structures has not been well explored. This paper presents studies on reliability analysis and design optimization for nonlinear structures, by using the Kriging based method and First-order reliability method (FORM). Numerical studies on nonlinear reinforced concrete structures and steel frame structures are carried out to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods. The results demonstrate that the FORM and Kriging based methods have the same accuracy as those from Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method. Reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) is conducted for nonlinear structures, in which the dimensions of structures can be optimized and the target occurrence probability can be achieved. Compared with FORM based RBDO method, the Kriging based method is more accurate and efficient. The response sensitivity is not required in the Kriging based method, which makes it more versatile.

AB  - The paper presents results of studies aimed at the determination of the possibility of demand prediction based on its sales variability in the past. For a group of selected products, the coefficient of variation in subsequent weeks was calculated and introduced as an input to a Nonlinear Autoregressive Neural Network model. The neural network model predicted future demand on the basis of what it has learned guided by historical data input to it. The quality of the match was determined using the coefficient of the residual sum, calculated as the sum of residuals is the distance between the actual and the predicted value and by means of the mean squared error value. In the analyses, the impact of the type of learning function and the size of the delay vector, which are parameters of the neural network, were investigated. The type of function which guarantees the best quality of the predictive model was determined.

AB  - In this paper, we construct a actual system of image inpainting based on the image inpainting system model[1] which was proposed before, in order to repair more types, more broken images in the different field and restore them more efficiently,because there is no one "universal" or more general algorithm can repair all types of images. The proposed system integrates the commonly used several typical algorithms, when using these algorithms to repair the image, adding some knowledge of human-assisted analysis to help users select the appropriate algorithm for image restoration. It is necessary that the broken images needs classifies subjectively and objectively before inpainting and the result of image inpainting needs estimate subjectively and objectively after inpainting. The estimation results of image repairing can analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the various algorithms; it can provide users with appropriate algorithms selected. This system also has the self-learning function to make the system more flexibility and practicability.

AB  - The important field of research in ship operation is related to the high efficiency of transportation, the convenience of maneuvering ships and the safety of navigation. For these purposes, many intelligent technologies for ship automation have been required and studied. In this paper, we propose an intelligent voice instruction-based learning (VIBL) method and discuss the building of a ship's steering control system based on this method. The VIBL system concretely consists of two functions: a text conversion function where an instructor's inputted voice is recognized and converted to text, and a linguistic instruction based learning function where the text instruction is understood through a searching process of given meaning elements. As a study method, the fuzzy theory is adopted to build maneuvering models of steersmen and then the existing LIBL is improved and combined with the voice recognition technology to propose the VIBL. The ship steering control system combined with VIBL is tested in a ship maneuvering simulator and its validity is shown.

AB  - Both linguistic and genetic evolution involve copying and mutation of variants. The simplest copying process assumes that variants are reproduced at a rate equal to their current frequency, exemplified by Kimura's stepping stone model of neutral evolution, and the voter model. In this case, spatial patterns are driven by noise. In the linguistic context, an alternative possibility is that speakers preferentially select variants which are already popular, yielding patterns driven by surface tension, exemplified by the Ising model. In this paper, we model language change using a spatial network of speakers, inspired by the Hopfield neural network. The model's universality class-Voter or Ising-is determined by speakers' learning function. We view maps generated by the Survey of English Dialects as samples from our network. Maximum likelihood analysis, and comparison of spatial auto-correlations between real and simulated maps, indicates that the underlying copying processes is more likely to belong to the conformity-driven Ising class.

AB  - Surrogate model techniques have been widely used for structural systems with expensively evaluated simulations. However, their application to system reliability problems meets the challenge since approximating multiple implicit performance functions is required to estimate small failure probabilities. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of a newly active learning method based on polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) to alleviate the problem. The method employs Bayesian compressed sensing (BCS) technique which incorporates a parameterized prior to establish the PCE with a sparse structure. Then, a new composite learning function is developed to update sparse PCEs adaptively by iteratively selecting new training points near the system failure surface until the preset target accuracy is satisfied. This criterion can identify important failure modes and thus guarantee that computation cost will be spent only on areas with a significant probability content. Three examples including a parallel and two series systems are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Running a reliability analysis on engineering problems involving complex numerical models can be computationally very expensive, requiring advanced simulation methods to reduce the overall numerical cost. Gaussian process based active learning methods for reliability analysis have emerged as a promising way for reducing this computational cost. In this paper, we propose a methodology to quantify the sensitivity of the failure probability estimator to uncertainties generated by the Gaussian process and the sampling strategy. This quantification also enables to control the whole error associated to the failure probability estimate and thus provides an accuracy criterion on the estimation. Thus, an active learning approach integrating this analysis to reduce the main source of error and stopping when the global variability is sufficiently low is introduced. The approach is proposed for both a Monte Carlo based method as well as an importance sampling based method, seeking to improve the estimation of rare event probabilities. Performance of the proposed strategy is then assessed on several examples.

AB  - To ensure the reliability of complex structures, a novel reliability assessment method combining an active learning kriging (ALK) model with adaptive weighted importance sampling (AWIS), the ALK-AIWS, was proposed in this work. The initial design of experiment (DoE) points were first generated using a modified Metropolis algorithm to construct a kriging metamodel. The Markov chain state seeds were then used as the centers for the importance sampling density function to simulate the training data in a given important region. Thus, the kriging surrogate model was updated using the revised DoE produced by the active learning function, and the failure probability can be evaluated using the entire training data set. An AWIS method was also introduced considering the contribution of the design point to the structural failure probability. Finally, the failure probabilities of several numerical examples and a complex engineering design case were evaluated verifying the efficiency, accuracy, and applicability of the proposed ALK-AWIS method, which provides an alternative approach to reliability evaluation in practical engineering applications.

AB  - Although an accurate reliability assessment is essential to build a resilient infrastructure, it usually requires time-consuming computation. To reduce the computational burden, machine learning-based surrogate models have been used extensively to predict the probability of failure for structural designs. Nevertheless, the surrogate model still needs to compute and assess a certain number of training samples to achieve sufficient prediction accuracy. This paper proposes a new surrogate method for reliability analysis called Adaptive Hyperball Kriging Reliability Analysis (AHKRA). The AHKRA method revolves around using a hyperball-based sampling region. The radius of the hyperball represents the precision of reliability analysis. It is iteratively adjusted based on the number of samples required to evaluate the probability of failure with a target coefficient of variation. AHKRA adopts samples in a hyperball instead of an n-sigma rule-based sampling region to avoid the curse of dimensionality. The application of AHKRA in ten mathematical and two practical cases verifies its accuracy, efficiency, and robustness as it outperforms previous Kriging-based methods.

AB  - Cold bending is widely used in the forming of curtain-wall glass because of its simplicity, low cost and short construction period. However, residual stress is always generated in the glass during the process of cold-bending; if this stress is greater than the strength of the glass, the curtain wall will break. In this paper, an analysis model of cold-bending stress on a glass surface is developed using a finite element method to predict the residual stress of cold-bent glass. An experimental platform for measuring the cold-bending stress of the curtain-wall glass is built to verify the results of the finite element analysis. Considering the influence of random factors, a reliability analysis of cold bent curtain-wall glass is performed using Monte Carlo simulation method and adaptive KrigingMonte Carlo simulation method. Furthermore, reliability sensitivity analysis of curtain-wall glass is used to estimate the impact of different parameters' random variation on the reliability of the curtain-wall. The above studies have important guiding significance for practical applications, and can provide a theoretical basis for the engineering design and construction of glass-curtain walls.

In this paper, first, the response mechanism of different users in the electricity market environment to the electricity price and demand response policy is analyzed, and a market behavior evaluation index system is built based on the aspects of electricity purchase potential, electricity price sensitivity, demand response potential, etc. Based on the index quantification of the initial user samples, the users' initial class is determined with the secondary clustering method.

AB  - The surrogate-model based active learning method has a satisfactory trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, which has been widely used in reliability analysis. In this paper, an active learning function called the potential risk function (PRF) is proposed to adaptively estimate the failure probability. It should be emphasized that the proposed potential risk function is not limited to the Kriging metamodel, which can be combined with other mainstream surrogate models in principle. Further, an effective convergence based on the failure probabilities in 10 consecutive iterations is adopted to prevent the pre-mature of the surrogate-model based active learning method (SM-ALM). Four validation examples (one numerical example, two benchmark examples, and one practical engineering problem) are applied to validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed SM-ALM.

AB  - Along with the changing interest of Cable Television users, it is difficult to make personalized recommendation and put advertisement intelligently for users. This research is aimed at the viewing behaving of Cable Television users based on long-term interest. The users' interest attenuation model and the interest enhancement model are constructed to precisely describe the users' viewing behaviors in multi-aspect. The interest attenuation model was used to deal with the forgetting rule of interest by the Ebbinghaus forgetting attenuation function. The interest enhancement model solved the problem of increased interest through repetitive learning function. Finally combining the above two functions, the research of Cable Television users' behaviors based on long-term interest was proposed in this paper. This method could be used to quantify the users' interest to yield long-term interest indicators, and ultimately it can be used for Cable Television users' personalized program recommendation.

AB  - Large-scale data sets from online training and game platforms offer the opportunity for more extensive and more precise investigations of human learning than is typically achievable in the laboratory. However, because people make their own choices about participation, any investigation into learning using these data sets must simultaneously model performance-that is, the learning function-and participation. Using a data set of 54 million gameplays from the online brain training site Lumosity, we show that learning functions of participants are systematically biased by participation policies that vary with age. Older adults who are poorer performers are more likely to drop out than older adults who perform well. Younger adults show no such effect. Using this knowledge, we can extrapolate group learning functions that correct for these age-related differences in dropout.

AB  - This paper presents a novel multiple criteria active learning method developed in the framework of epsilon-insensitive support vector regression (SVR) to estimate biophysical parameters from remotely sensed images. The proposed active learning method chooses the most informative and representative unlabeled samples by jointly evaluating three criteria: i) relevancy, ii) diversity, and iii) density of samples. All three criteria are implemented according to the SVR properties and are applied in two clustering-based successive steps. In the first step, a novel measure to select the most relevant samples that have high probability to be located either outside or on the boundary of the c-tube of SVR is defined. In the second step, a novel measure to select diverse samples among the relevant patterns from the high density regions in the feature space is defined to better model the SVR learning function. Experiments applied to the estimation of tree stem volume show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Throughout the 1990s, increasing attention was devoted to the use of violence by adolescents, especially violence used in and around schools. While there are numerous suggested solutions to this social problem, there are fewer suggestions that focus on the role of peaceable schools. Peaceable schools, in practice, would create environments where there is less chance of violence and where teachers and administrators would spend less time disciplining students and more time encouraging the learning function of the school. The pursuit of peaceable schools is informed by peacemaking criminology, the public health approach to violence prevention, and a critique of the dominator model of U.S. society. In addition, for peaceable schools to exist, the foundation of a peaceable community is needed. Building toward this goal requires community-based support and programming for nonviolent approaches to conflict. A review of one community-based program serves to highlight the necessity to get youths involved in programming designed to serve youths. Overall, the process of creating peaceable schools is shown as long and arduous, yet meaningful and rich in possibilities.

AB  - This paper proposes a single-loop strategy for time-variant system reliability analysis by combining multiple response Gaussian process (MRGP) and Kriging model. Firstly, a new strategy is provided to decouple the double-loop strategy of extreme-value-based time-variant system reliability analysis, where the extreme value response in the double-loop strategy is approximated by the best value in the initial points to avoid the inner-loop extremal optimization. Then, the extreme value response surface is directly built based on the approximated extreme value using the MRGP model. Meanwhile, a Kriging model based on initial points is also proposed to search a new sample point. Furthermore, in order to update the initial sample points and improve the accuracy of the proposed strategy, three learning functions (U-function, EFF-function and H-function) and expected improvement (EI) function are combined to select a new point that resides as close to the extreme value response surface as possible. Finally, several examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a reliability analysis method for automated vehicles equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC) and autonomous emergency braking (AEB) systems to avoid collision with an obstacle in front of the vehicle. The proposed approach consists of two main elements, namely uncertainty modeling of traffic conditions and model-based reliability analysis. In the uncertainty modeling step, a recently developed Gaussian mixture copula method is employed to accurately represent the uncertainty in the road traffic conditions using the real-world data, and to capture the complicated correlations between different variables. Based on the uncertainty modeling of traffic conditions, an adaptive Kriging surrogate modeling method with an active learning function is then used to efficiently and accurately evaluate the collision-avoidance reliability of an automated vehicle. The application of the proposed method to the Department of Transportation Safety Pilot Model Deployment database and an in-house built Advanced Driver Assist Systems with ACC and AEB controllers demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in evaluating the collision-avoidance reliability.

AB  - The metamodel-assisted reliability method opens a promising way to achieve efficient structural reliability assessment for structures with expensive-to-evaluate simulations. The advances in machine learning promote the development of the metamodel technique over the last decades. In this study, an active learning reliability method is presented by the combination of the extreme learning machine(ELM) and an efficient sequential sampling method with the framework of the Bayesian optimization theory. To determine the hyperparameters of ELM automatically, an adaptive extreme learning machine is introduced to approximate the performance function for reliability analysis. Furthermore, a novel active learning function inspired by the ensemble learning strategy is established to select the next best sample for approximation model refinement. Correspondingly, an effective stopping criterion on the cross-validation technique is built to terminate the active learning process timely. Four problems including numerical examples and practical engineering structures are analyzed. The test results show that the proposed method provides a satisfactory failure probability estimation with fewer performance function evaluations for these different reliability problems.

AB  - This paper proposes an active learning-based Gaussian process (AL-GP) metamodelling method to estimate the cumulative as well as complementary cumulative distribution function (CDF/CCDF) for forward uncertainty quantification (UQ) problems. Within the field of UQ, previous studies focused on developing AL-GP approaches for reliability (rare event probability) analysis of expensive black-box solvers. A naive iteration of these algorithms with respect to different CDF/CCDF threshold values would yield a discretized CDF/CCDF. However, this approach inevitably leads to a trade off between accuracy and computational efficiency since both depend (in opposite way) on the selected discretization. In this study, a specialized error measure and a learning function are developed such that the resulting AL-GP method is able to efficiently estimate the CDF/CCDF for a specified range of interest without an explicit dependency on discretization. Particularly, the proposed AL-GP method is able to simultaneously provide accurate CDF and CCDF estimation in their median-low probability regions. Three numerical examples are introduced to test and verify the proposed method.

AB  - With the time-consuming computations incurred by nested double-loop strategy and multiple performance functions, the enhancement of computational efficiency for the non-probabilistic reliability estimation and optimization is a challenging problem in the assessment of structural safety. In this study, a novel importance learning method (ILM) is proposed on the basis of active learning technique using Kriging metamodel, which builds the Kriging model accurately and efficiently by considering the influence of the most concerned point. To further accelerate the convergence rate of non-probabilistic reliability analysis, a new stopping criterion is constructed to ensure accuracy of the Kriging model. For solving the non-probabilistic reliability-based design optimization (NRBDO) problems with multiple non-probabilistic constraints, a new active learning function is further developed based upon the ILM for dealing with this problem efficiently. The proposed ILM is verified by two non-probabilistic reliability estimation examples and three NRBDO examples. Comparing with the existing active learning methods, the optimal results calculated by the proposed ILM show high performance in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

AB  - Scheduling with learning effects has received lots of research attention lately. However, the multiple-agent setting with learning consideration is relatively limited. On the other hand, the actual processing time of a job under an uncontrolled learning effect will drop to zero precipitously as the number of the jobs already processed increases. This is rather absurd in reality. Based on these observations, this paper considers a single-machine two-agent scheduling problem in which the actual processing time of a job depends not only on the job's scheduled position, but also on a control parameter. The objective is to minimize the total weighted completion time of jobs from the first agent with the restriction that no tardy job is allowed for the second agent. A branch-and-bound algorithm incorporated with several dominance properties and lower bounds is proposed to derive the optimal solution for the problem. In addition, genetic algorithms (GAs) are also provided to obtain the near-optimal solution. Finally, a computational experiment is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms.

AB  - This paper investigates the system reliability analysis under random and interval variables (SRA-RI). When performance functions in SRA-RI are replaced by surrogate models, it is found that the composite projection outlines on the composite limit-state surface should be well approximated so as to accurately assess system failure probability bounds. Then a composite-projection-outline-based active learning Kriging (CPOK) method is proposed in this paper. To refine the approximated composite projection outlines, three system learning functions are defined in CPOK for parallel, series and mixed systems, respectively. Based on these three functions, new points around the composite projection outlines are sequentially selected and used for the update of Kriging models. Meanwhile, prediction uncertainties of Kriging models are quantified and used for terminating the update of Kriging models. Finally, system failure probability bounds are evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation. The advantages of CPOK are validated by four numerical examples and a piezoelectric energy harvester example.

AB  - Time series has been a popular research topic over the past decade. Salient subsequences of time series that can benefit the learning task, e.g., classification or clustering, are called shapelets. Shapelet-based time series learning extracts these types of salient subsequences with highly informative features from a time series. Most existing methods for shapelet discovery must scan a large pool of candidate subsequences, which is a time-consuming process. A recent work, [1], uses regression learning to discover shapelets in a time series; however, it only considers learning shapelets from labeled time series data. This paper proposes an Unsupervised Salient Subsequence Learning (USSL) model that discovers shapelets without the effort of labeling. We developed this new learning function by integrating the strengths of shapelet learning, shapelet regularization, spectral analysis and pseudo-label to simultaneously and automatically learn shapelets to help clustering unlabeled time series better. The optimization model is iteratively solved via a coordinate descent algorithm. Experiments show that our USSL can learn meaningful shapelets, with promising results on real-world and synthetic data that surpass current state-of-the-art unsupervised time series learning methods.

Three ways to reduce the hardware cost are also analyzed; and 4) we implement the online learning function using the developed CNN system with a binary spike-time-dependent plasticity protocol and achieve up to 94% accuracy for the online learning tasks.

AB  - This work investigates robust monotonic convergent iterative learning control (ILC) for uncertain linear systems in both time and frequency domains, and the ILC algorithm optimizing the convergence speed in terms of l(2) norm of error signals is derived. First, it is shown that the robust monotonic convergence of the ILC system can be established equivalently by the positive definiteness of a matrix polynomial over some set. Then, a necessary and sufficient condition in the form of sum of squares for the positive definiteness is proposed, which is amendable to the feasibility of linear matrix inequalities. Based on such a condition, the optimal ILC algorithm that maximizes the convergence speed is obtained by solving a set of convex optimization problems. Moreover, the order of the learning function can be chosen arbitrarily so that the designers have the flexibility to decide the complexity of the learning algorithm.

AB  - Morris water maze data are most commonly analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance in which daily test sessions are analyzed as an unordered categorical variable. This approach, however, may lack power, relies heavily on post hoc tests of daily performance that can complicate interpretation, and does not target the nonlinear trends evidenced in learning data. The present project used Monte Carlo simulation to compare the relative strengths of the traditional approach with both linear and nonlinear mixed effects modeling that identifies the learning function for each animal and condition. Both trend-based mixed effects modeling approaches showed much greater sensitivity to identifying real effects, and the nonlinear approach provided uniformly better fits of learning trends. The common practice of removing a rat from the maze after 90 s, however, proved more problematic for the nonlinear approach and produced an underestimate of y-axis intercepts. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose When dealing with simple functional functions, traditional reliability calculation methods, such as the linear second-order moment and quadratic second ordered moment, Monte Carlo simulation method, are powerful. However, when the functional function of the structure shows strong nonlinearity or even implicit, traditional methods often fail to meet the actual needs of engineering in terms of calculation accuracy or efficiency. Design/methodology/approach To improve the reliability analysis efficiency and calculation accuracy of complex structures, the reliability analysis methods based on parametric and semi-parametric models are analyzed.

AB  - A Markov chain simulation was performed to extract points in a failure region. A Kriging metamodel was constructed to approximate a limit state based on the points extracted by the Markov chain simulation. A kernel sampling density was constructed to approximate the optimal importance sampling density. The points extracted in the failure region by the Markov chain simulation were assumed as a mean of each kernel. An importance sampling method was applied to calculate the failure probability. In the importance sampling method, points are extracted from the kernel in the vicinity of a limit state. Considering the statistical distance as well as the learning function, additional experimental points were selected for the kriging metamodel. A stable numerical calculation method was applied to find the parameters of the kernel sampling density. The completeness of the Kriging metamodel was evaluated on the basis of possible changes in failure probability.

AB  - The active learning Kriging methodology is widely employed in structural reliability analyses, but there are disadvantages in existing studies concerning computational efficiency and prediction accuracy. In response, a two-stage hybrid algorithm, AK-TSAGL, is proposed in this paper by combining global exploration and local exploitation for enhanced structural reliability analysis. Initially, it identifies the global optimal point by considering predicted variance nearing the limit state surface and candidate point distribution characteristics. Then, it defines local regions around the global optimal point for further analysis. High-quality learning points are identified using a synthetic local evaluation indicator to update the Kriging model. A termination criterion based on maximum relative error ensures convergence with shorter time and higher prediction accuracy. Results from four numerical examples and comparisons with conventional methods demonstrate that AK-TSAGL maintains prediction accuracy and conducts efficient reliability analysis with fewer sample points, offering dynamic accuracy adjustment through various threshold settings. Practical application cases to the reliability analysis of a slider-crank mechanism and a bridge truss structure show its advantages in engineering with more performance factors. This study contributes to advancing Kriging modeling techniques for structural reliability analysis.

AB  - Traffic oscillation on freeways results in abrupt and frequent vehicle deceleration, which remarkably increases crash risks. Artificial Intelligence based traffic control provides a new opportunity for addressing the safety issues. This study aims at proposing a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based variable speed limits (VSL) control algorithm to reduce crash risks associated with oscillations. The state, action and reward, which are the critical components in the RL, were designed carefully for safety improvement. The RL was trained to learn the optimal speed limit for various traffic states to achieve a goal of safety optimization. A rear-end crash risk model was applied to assess crash risks associated with oscillations near freeway bottlenecks. The cell transmission model was modified as the simulation platform for evaluating the control effects. The results showed that after the training process, the proposed RL-based VSL control successfully reduced the crash risks by 19.4%. A continuous online learning function was developed in RL to enhance the robustness of our strategy. The results showed that with continuous learning, the RL-based VSL control performed reasonably well under lower driver compliance situations.

AB  - Over the past decade, researches on adaptive Kriging-based reliability estimation have been focused on enhancing its performance from three aspects including the simulation methods, learning functions, and stopping criteria, whereas few efforts have been dedi-cated to give a comprehensive guidance on design of experiment of the initial sampling methods, which directly influences the performance of the surrogate and surrogate-based reliability estimation. This paper presents a comparative study on the adaptive model -ing schemes for Kriging-based reliability estimation. Comparison on six common sampling methods for the single step Kriging is conducted with a typical numerical example, to find an optimal initial sampling scheme for the surrogates. A comparative study on the per-formance of the hybrid adaptive schemes for the adaptive Kriging, each of which includes the initial sampling method, the learning scheme and the corresponding stop criterion, is then implemented on three typical examples, in order to heuristically provide a unique hy-brid adaptive scheme for Kriging-based structural reliability estimation. It can synthetically consider the dimension of the input variables, the nonlinearity of the limit-state function and the application scenarios.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aiming at analyzing the structural fuzzy failure probability with probability inputs and fuzzy-state assumption (profust model), an adaptive kriging model-based sequentially truncated Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method is investigated, where estimating the fuzzy failure probability can be transformed into identifying the absolute safety domain, the absolute failure domain, and the exact performance function values of the fuzzy safety-failure transition domain. To this end, in this study, three kriging models are sequentially constructed to realize the three aims, respectively. To further improve the efficiency of adaptively updating kriging model, adaptive radial-based importance sampling technique is embedded to divide the whole MCS candidate sampling pool (CSP) into several sub-CSPs. Then, the kriging model is updated sequentially in each sub-CSP instead of the whole CSP, and the samples dropped into the optimal hypersphere of the absolute safety domain can be truncated and do not participate in the CSP of updating the kriging model so that the size of whole MCS CSP and the size of CSP in each learning process of updating kriging are reduced simultaneously. As a result, the efficiency of estimating the fuzzy failure probability is enhanced. The results of two examples verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Reliability-based robust design optimization (RBRDO) has been widely studied to ensure the necessary robustness and reliability throughout the product life cycle. However, most of the existing researches on RBRDO could obtain robust solutions that meet the minimal reliability requirements but make reliability improvement difficult. The critical contribution of this work is to propose a novel multi-objective RBRDO framework based on active learning Kriging modeling. Specifically, the framework incorporates quality loss and system reliability in the objective, enabling it to enhance reliability while maintaining robustness. According to the merits of the active learning Kriging model, an improved U learning function is introduced to the system failure boundary modeling. Additionally, the modified expected improvement criterion is adopted for the target response modeling in the system safe domain. Moreover, the Kriging model of the system reliability index is established with a two-stage active learning strategy. Finally, using the NSGA-II algorithm to obtain a uniformly distributed Pareto front. Example results show that the proposed framework can serve as a new approach to solving the RBRDO problem and the Pareto front provides the opportunity to enhance reliability while maintaining robustness.

AB  - The function of failure probability varying with distribution parameters of random inputs is referred as failure probability function (FPF), it is often required in reliability-based design optimization. However, it is a computational challenging task since large number of expensive model evaluations are needed to estimate the failure probability at every distribution parameter. A method combining adaptive Kriging with Monte Carlo simulation is employed by this paper to efficiently estimate the FPF. Based on the augmented reliability theory and Bayes' rule, the estimation of FPF is firstly transformed into that of the augmented failure probability and conditional joint probability density function (PDF) of distribution parameters on failure domain. Then, a Kriging model for the actual performance function is iteratively trained by the U-learning function until the stopping criterion is satisfied. The well-trained Kriging model can efficiently and accurately recognize the failure samples in the sample pool, on which the augmented failure probability and conditional joint PDF of distribution parameters on failure domain can be simultaneously estimated without extra model evaluations. The results of test examples illustrate that the method used in this work is more efficient than the existing methods, but its accuracy depends on the PDF approximation algorithms.

AB  - It is quite challenging to attain an accurate reliability estimation on complex structures with low computational burden. Therefore, an active learning method combining the response surface model with the Gaussian process (GP) of residual fitting and reliability-based sequential sampling design is proposed for structural reliability analysis. This method first utilizes a random quadrilateral grid to perturb the uniform design sampling and generates a small set of initial design of experiments (DoE) to establish a high-precision initial response surface model efficiently. Then, a GP model for residual prediction is constructed by using the residuals of the initial response surface model, which allows the response surface function to be closer to the limit state function (LSF). Further, areliability-based expected improvement (REI) learning function, which inherits the property of the EI function and considers the probability of feasibility of the samples, is developed for the selection of the most feasible points to update the response surface model and the GP model. The importance sampling (IS) combined with the proposed method is employed to assess the rare failure probability of structures. Ultimately, five numerical examples are used to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.

AB  - A quantified active learning Kriging-based (qAK) methodology for structural reliability analysis is presented. The proposed approach is based on an updated probability density function (PDF), which is dominant in the vicinity of the limit-state surface. This PDF is created using weights based on an improved learning function called the most probable misclassification function. This function is used as a metric for efficiently updating the Kriging model, as it symmetrically quantifies the uncertainty of candidate points in terms of the model's accuracy. The proposed approach accurately approximates the points that lie on the limit-state surface. Moreover, a probabilistic-based stopping criterion is proposed. The new support points are selected using the weighted K-means algorithm and the sample from the updated PDF. Thus, the method does not require solving an optimization problem or using a sampling algorithm. The proposed qAK methods are more reliable and robust than previous implementations of the Kriging method for structural reliability assessment. The proposed approach is presented within the framework of standard reliability methods, i.e., the Monte Carlo and the Subset Simulation methods. The efficiency of the proposed qAK methods is demonstrated with the aid of six case studies.

AB  - Metamodel-based method is a wise reliability analysis technique because it uses the metamodel to substitute the actual limit state function under the predefined accuracy. Adaptive Kriging (AK) is a famous metamodel in reliability analysis for its flexibility and efficiency. AK combined with the importance sampling (IS) method abbreviate as AK-IS can extremely reduce the size of candidate sampling pool in the updating process of Kriging model, which makes the AK-based reliability method more suitable for estimating the small failure probability. In this paper, an error-based stopping criterion of updating the Kriging model in the AK-IS method is constructed and two considerable maximum relative error estimation methods between the failure probability estimated by the current Kriging model and the limit state function are derived. By controlling the maximum relative error, the accuracy of the estimate can be adjusted flexibly. Results in three case studies show that the error-based stopping criterion based AK-IS method can achieve the predefined accuracy level and simultaneously enhance the efficiency of updating the Kriging model.

AB  - With the scientific development of the sports industry, as a kind of important quantitative analysis method, the prediction in the field of physical is bound to be paid more and more attention. People's requirements on the accuracy of the data will be more and more high. From the athletes' selection to the athletes' performance prediction, it depends on the statistics of a large number of historical data. As a result, the development of modern mathematics and computer technology is widely used in the field of physical education, such as grey theory, fuzzy mathematics, and neural network and so on. Grey forecasting model is suitable for analysing the nonlinear and uncertain system. But this method usually has a large prediction error. Artificial neural network has a strong self-learning function, so it can train the predictable data. However, it requires a large sample data set. Therefore, this paper tries to use the particle swarm optimization algorithm to optimize the parameters of neural network, and uses a discrete method to improve the neural network, so as to achieve the purpose of accurate prediction. The experimental results show that the fitting residuals of the neural network algorithm are small, and the prediction accuracy is high.

AB  - In recent years, the surrogate-assisted reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) methods have been continuously developed, and numerous advanced optimization strategies have boosted efficiency and accuracy. However, ensuring sufficient accuracy and feasibility at the optimal is still a challenge. In order to achieve a wellbalanced between efficiency, accuracy, and optimal feasibility, in this work, a RBDO strategy using quantile surrogates by improved PC-Kriging model is proposed. The novelty of the proposed method lies in the following main aspects: Firstly, an improved learning function has been developed to significantly enhance the convergence efficiency during the construction of the PC-Kriging model. Secondly, in the RBDO analysis process, a novel "MP+EI" combination point addition strategy is adopted to enhance the approximation of the surrogate model to the optimum of the objective function. It can further improve optimization efficiency and accuracy. On the basis of the rough probability constrained surrogate model established by the global enrichment strategy, a local refinement strategy is introduced to guarantee the accuracy of the quantile evaluation of the probability constrained surrogate model for each iteration solution during the optimization process. Finally, the proposed method is validated by three typical RBDO test examples and one engineering application example.

AB  - Many systems have multiple stochastic responses, which correspond to multiple Limit-State Functions (LSFs). Over the past decade, researches on adaptive Kriging-based failure probability estimation have been focused on enhancing its performance for single response, whereas few efforts have been devoted to simultaneously coping with multiple responses of a system. Those methods have to estimate multiple responses in the same system one by one, potential repeated calculation is inevitable. This paper proposes a novel methodology for multiple re-sponses within a single run, which includes an Adaptive Kriging-Monte Carlo Simulation for multiple responses (AK-MCS-m) and an Adaptive Kriging-Generalized Subset Simulation (AK-GSS). Once the surrogate for a certain LSF meets the requirement, the others are kept updating until the accuracy of ones for all are accepted. Two learning schemes considering the optimal effect and the averaging effect for all the LSFs are proposed. A heuristic comparative study on learning schemes for simultaneously constructing the Kriging models for multiple re-sponses are conducted on AK-MCS-m. GSS is adopted to simultaneously estimate all the failure probabilities upon the constructed Kriging models and hence accelerate convergence for the outer loop of the simulation. Four examples are used to demonstrate the performance of the methodology.

AB  - It is of great significance to incorporate various uncertainties into the design optimization of structures and other engineering systems. Many reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) methods have been developed, but their practical applications can be limited if the reliability consideration entails a large number of evaluations of performance functions, especially for those requiring time-consuming simulations. To overcome the challenge, this paper proposes a new RBDO method that employs quantile surrogates of the performance functions to identify the admissible domain, termed the probability-feasible design domain. Gaussian process models of the quantile surrogates are updated adaptively through an exploration-exploitation trade-off based on inherent randomness and the model uncertainty of the surrogate. The method guides the computational simulations toward the domain in which the quantile estimation can make the greatest contribution to the optimization process. The validity and efficiency of the proposed RBDO method using quantile surrogates by adaptive Gaussian process (QS-AGP) are demonstrated using several numerical examples. The results confirm that QS-AGP facilitates convergence to a reliable optimum design with a significantly reduced number of function evaluations compared to existing RBDO approaches.

AB  - For structural reliability analysis with time-consuming performance functions, an innovative design of experiment (DoE) strategy of the Kriging model is proposed, which is named as the stepwise accuracy-improvement strategy. The epistemic randomness of the performance value at any point provided by the Kriging model is used to derive an accuracy measure of the Kriging model. The basic idea of the proposed strategy is to enhance the accuracy of the Kriging model with the best next point that has the largest improvement with regard to the accuracy measure. An optimization problem is developed to define the best next point. The objective function is the expectation that quantifies how much an untried point could enhance the accuracy of the Kriging model. Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and Gauss-Hermite quadrature are employed to make several approximations to solve the optimization problem and get the best next point. A structural reliability analysis method is also constructed based on the proposed strategy and the accuracy measure employed. Several examples are studied. The results validate the advantages of the proposed DoE strategy.

AB  - This paper proposes a system active learning Kriging (SALK) method to handle system reliability-based design optimization (SRBDO) problems, where responses of all constraints at an input can be obtained simultaneously by running a multiple response model. In SALK, to select update points around the limit-state surfaces, three new system active learning functions are respectively defined for parallel, series and combined systems. The confidence interval of estimation of system failure probability at intermediate SRBDO solutions is considered in the stopping condition of Kriging update to reduce unnecessary update points used for refining the region far from the final SRBDO solution. Based on updated Kriging models, system failure probability is estimated by Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), and its partial derivative with respect to random variables is calculated by stochastic sensitivity analysis. The efficiency of the proposed SALK method for SRBDO is validated by four examples, including a power harvester design. The results indicate that SALK can locally approximate the limit-state surfaces around the final SRBDO solution and efficiently reduce the computational cost on the refinement of the region far from the final SRBDO solution.

AB  - Efficient structural reliability analysis method is crucial to solving reliability analysis of complex structural problems. High-computational cost and low-failure probability problems greatly limit the efficiency in structural reliability analysis problems, causing the safety and reliability of the structure to be questioned. In this work, a highly efficient structural reliability analysis method coupling active Kriging algorithm with conjugate first order reliability method (AK-CFORM) is proposed. Specifically, the resample strategy is considered to reduce the number of samples evaluated in each active learning process; the uniform sampling is used to better balance global and local optimal problems; the conjugate map is used to improve the robustness of analytical first order reliability method; and the approximate numerical differential formula is proposed to solve the problems of non-convergence when solving the gradient of the Kriging surrogate model. Finally, three numerical cases and four engineering cases are used to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed AK-CFORM has greater advantages in the number of calling system response and surrogate model with robust and accurate performance.

AB  - The structured sparse model incorporates dependencies among coefficients, and exploiting intrablock correlations significantly enhances recovery performance. The reconstruction performance of existing block sparse recovery algorithms relies on prior knowledge of blockwise sparse coefficients, including the number of blocks, boundaries, and sizes, which severely restricts the applicability of algorithms in scenarios like radar reconstruction. This article proposes a regularized block sparse Bayesian algorithm with structured prior learning, which involves a two-stage processing procedure. The first stage includes the acquisition of space-temporal hierarchical prior information. It introduces a regularization penalty term in the cost function to constrain and optimize hyperparameters, thereby promoting block correlations among neighboring coefficients. In the second stage, refined recovery is executed for nonzero blocks using a model with multiple measurement vectors (MMVs) constructed from space-temporal dimensional data. This model captures temporal correlations among multiple snapshots and blocks correlations within the prior coefficient structure, enabling joint parameter reconstruction across multiple domains. Simulation results demonstrate that compared with the conventional block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL) algorithm, the proposed approach exhibits significant advantages in reconstruction performance under an unknown block sparse model.

AB  - This article focuses on the adaptive Kriging metamodel-based reliability analysis for reducing a sequential number of calls of the complex original functions. To avoid the repetitive and tedious deterministic response analysis with stochastic simulation method (including Monte Carlo Simulation and its various improvement, such as importance sampling, subset simulation) in reliability analysis, herein a novel sequential sampling strategy related to Kriging metamodel is proposed, which is implemented based on information entropy theory. In addition, the generalized F-discrepancy method is simultaneously quoted to further optimize the candidate pool to improve the effectiveness of the training metamodel. Finally, a new structural reliability analysis method is proposed, which continuously reduces the number of deterministic analysis of structures without sacrificing accuracy. To highlight the applicability of the method and verify its accuracy and effectiveness, a series of typical examples are tested and compared, including highly nonlinear limit state functions, high-dimension performance function with analytic expressions and dynamic reliability analysis of nonlinear engineering structures subject to seismic excitation with implicit performance function. Numerical results show that significant computational savings and desired accuracy can be achieved when dealing with different reliability analysis cases.

AB  - Based on stress-strength interference theory, calculating the reliability by using the coefficient of variation is a common method for the optimal design of a planetary transmission system. This method calculates the reliability by assuming the tangential force is zero while this is quite different from the real working condition. In this paper, the authors propose a novel reliability design and optimization method of the planetary gear, using the genetic algorithm, based on Kriging model. The Kriging method is used to establish the gear reliability model to simplify the reliability calculation. Then the Kriging model is optimized by using the genetic algorithm to ensure the global optimal solution. To simulate the real working conditions of planetary gears, the discrete element method (DEM) is adopted to calculates the load variation coefficient of the planetary gear. By taking the double toothed roller crusher as case study, the optimization results show that proposed method can significantly improve the calculation efficiency, and compared with the traditional design, the volume increases by 36.96%, and the failure rate of the planetary gear decreases by 17.05%.

AB  - With the increasing service life of bogie frames, the risk of fatigue failure becomes significant, making fatigue reliability analysis crucial for ensuring operational safety. However, accurately analyzing fatigue reliability presents a significant challenge with uncertain factors such as load fluctuations, unstable material shaping, and dimensional manufacturing deviations. To address this, this paper establishes a comprehensive active learning reliability framework based on surrogate models, enabling high-fidelity modeling and precise fatigue reliability analysis of welded frames under parameter uncertainty. The material utilization method was developed using APDL for secondary development to efficiently evaluate frame fatigue failure indicators. The effectiveness of this method was validated by combining the improved Goodman-Smith fatigue limit diagram and test bench fatigue tests, which helped identify the locations on the frame most prone to fatigue fractures. An Atom Search Optimization-BP Neural Network surrogate model was established with the objective of maximum material utilization, and the fatigue reliability of the bogie frame was obtained by combining the active learning function and the Monte Carlo method. The results show that the uncertainty design parameters greatly impact the fatigue reliability of critical welded structures. The proposed method improves the accuracy and efficiency of the fatigue reliability analysis of the bogie frame.

AB  - Focusing on firm export activity as an important field within international business, this study corroborates the importance of experiential knowledge as the initial Uppsala model predicts. The model builds on the belief that experiential knowledge minimizes the risk and uncertainty of export operations. Additionally, the article examines a firm's capacity to widen this knowledge through its dynamic capacities, honing in on a firm's learning function. Thus, this article analyzes the role of innovation in exporting by investigating export product innovation and export market innovation, both strategic activities that allow experiential knowledge acquisition. The article uses a firm-level official dataset from a small developing country, Chile, examining data from 2006 to 2011. The results indicate, firstly, that experiential knowledge resulting from exporting to different and geographically distant markets increases the firm's export activity. Secondly, such export market innovation takes precedence over export product innovation. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license

AB  - This work presents a new application of Iterative Learning Control (ILC) in two respects. Firstly, the output signal is generated by a machine vision system. Secondly, ILC is applied to the extrusion process in Micro Robotic Deposition (mu RD), directly addressing the end product quality instead of contributors to end product quality such as position tracking. A P-type and model inversion learning function are both applied to the extrusion process, a system that has nonlinear dynamics and no readily available volumetric flowrate sensor. Theoretical and experimental results show that the nominal system is first order with a pure time delay. Both P-type and model inversion ILC improve the dynamics, with both systems providing better reference tracking. The ILC compensates for the unmodeled nonlinearities, realizing a reduction of RMS error to less than 20% of the initial value for the model inversion approach. Experiments are performed, displaying the ability to extrude precise and seamless closed shapes with the model inversion ILC. This is a necessary requirement for transitioning materials and embedding sensors in multimaterial mu RD.

AB  - A metal-ferroelectric-metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MFMOS-FET) with a Pt/SrBi2Ta2O9/Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si structure was fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) structure in order to improve the memory retention characteristics of ferroelectric neuron circuit. The al ca ratio of MOS capacitor to MFM capacitor was changed from 3 to 15 so that charge quantities induced in both capacitors were optimized. It was found that the memory operations and retention characteristics were considerably improved in the fabricated MFMOS-FET with an area ratio larger than 10, compared with those of the MFSFET previously fabricated using a Pt/SrBi2Ta2O9/Si structure. Next, a pulse frequency modulation (PFM)-type neuron circuit was fabricated using the MFMOS-FET and a CMOS Schmitt-trigger oscillator as a synapse and a neuron, respectively, and it was found that the oscillation frequency of the circuit remained almost unchanged over a period of 1 h.

AB  - The adjusting mechanism is an important part of an aero engine, and the wear degradation of clearance is widely present in its hinges. In this work, an adjusting mechanism with hinge clearance is analyzed by dynamic simulation and the wear depth is predicted precisely using a wear model. Based on that, a sequential reliability analysis of motion accuracy is carried out. In order to avoid the expensive computational cost of simulation, the adaptive radial-based importance sampling method combined with the adaptive Kriging model (AK-ARBIS) is employed, which describes the decrease of reliability in the standard normal space sphere by sphere with the updated Kriging model. To further utilize the information about each state of wear degradation, the advanced AK-ARBIS method is investigated. Through analytical examples of two typical mechanisms and the engineering application of the adjustment mechanism, the results show that the calculation cost of the sequential reliability analysis under different states can be effectively reduced.

AB  - In reliability engineering, estimating the failure probability of a system is one of the most challenging tasks. Since many applied engineering tasks are computationally expensive, it is challenging to estimate failure probabilities using acceptable computational costs. In this paper, to reduce computational cost, we combine a stratified importance sampling method with an adaptive Kriging strategy to estimate failure probabilities. Compared to the importance sampling method, stratified importance sampling needs fewer samples to get an estimate of failure probability with the same coefficient of variation. In the proposed method, we improve the importance sampling density and determine the best input variable for stratification through a Kriging-based model surrogate technique (like a Gaussian process regression). Then, the Kriging surrogate is further adaptively improved to get an accurate estimate of failure probability. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated using several analytic examples and then transferred to a carbon dioxide storage benchmark problem.

AB  - The main goal of structural reliability is to determine the failure probability of a structure by considering the randomness of the inputs. When the failure probability is small, the simulation methods may have high computational costs, especially for complicated and time-consuming numerical models. In this paper, a modified algorithm based on Monte Carlo simulations and the Kriging metamodel (AK-MCS) is proposed. The strategy is to replace the initial population with two or more populations. The next best point is identified by the iterative approach based on a point not in the original populations. There are enough candidate points near the performance function, which is important for refining the Kriging model. The modification can deal with multiple failure regions that are characterized by complex, high non-linear limit states. Five examples are provided to illustrate the efficiency of methodology. With reference to five case studies in the literature, satisfactory results and efficiency are obtained by the proposed algorithm.

TI  - Cooperative Multi-agent Traffic Signal Control System Using Fast Gradient-descent Function Approximation For V2I Networks
T2  - 2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS (ICC)
CP  - IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)
KW  - REAL-TIME
AB  - The traffic signal control is the basic method to solve the urban congestions problem coming with the accelerating urbanization. For large city, it is challenge to improve the traffic signal control flexibility to adapt the real-time traffic change while to decrease the computation complexity. This paper proposes a cooperative Q-learning with function approximation(CQFA) algorithm for vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) networks. By gathering the local intersection traffic information from V2I networks and employing cooperative behaviors with neighboring intersections, the algorithm can achieve the optimal policy without any central supervising agents. To address the curse of dimensionality effectively, the Q-learning function is approximated by using a fast gradient-descent function approximation method to pick out the optimal Q-learning action. The Q-learning with Function Approximation algorithm combining the cooperative mechanism balances the urban traffic flow and uses approximating strategy to decrease the computation dimensionality. It can improve the traffic throughout, reduce the average waiting time and avoid congestions. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB  - We propose a novel scheme for using supervised learning for function-based classification of objects in 3D images. During the learning process, a generic multi-level hierarchical description of object classes is constructed. The object classes are described in terms of functional components. The multi-level hierarchy is designed and constructed using a large set of signature-based reasoning and grading mechanisms. This set employs likelihood functions that are built as radial-based functions from the histograms of the object instances. During classification, a probabilistic matching measure is used to search through a finite graph to find the best assignment of geometric parts to the functional structures of each class. An object is assigned to the class that provides the highest matching value. Reuse of functional primitives in different classes enables easy expansion to new categories. We tested the proposed scheme on a database of about 1000 different 3D objects. The proposed scheme achieved high classification accuracy while using small training sets. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In order to effectively increase the control quality of the load frequency controller, this paper proposes a Cloud-Neural Network PI controller based on cloud theory to solve the adverse effects of uncertainties in interconnected power system. Cloud theory solves uncertain problems by skillfully combining probability statistics with fuzzy theory, but relies heavily on artificial experience, while proposed cloud neural network algorithm can learn cloud control rules by itself. Therefore, cloud-neural network PI controller can solve the problem of fixing the membership functions of input variables and fuzzy rules by clouds algorithm, and implement the nonlinear mapping between variables by neural network. Compared with cloud theory, this new algorithm retains self-learning function of the neural network and does not depend on artificial experience. On the Matlab platform, comparison of Cloud-Neural Network PI controller, Cloud PI controller and traditional PI controller is made in complex nonlinear power system, and simulation results show that proposed Cloud-Neural Network PI controller has strong adaptive and self-learning capabilities, presenting better robust performance and dynamic-static characteristic.

This paper mainly aims at introducing an abnormity diagnosis platform in electric power system. It is used to distinguish the abnormal point according to the historical data and expert experience, and put forward some resolving scheme to ensure the high reliability and stability of power grid.

This model can auto-get and modify knowledge in knowledge base, achieve a better real time phenomenon, through self-learning function and machine as well as interacting between human. The results show that this abnormity intelligent diagnoses platform is effective and faster.

AB  - The practical application of time-variant reliability analysis is limited by its computationally expensive models which describe the structural system behavior. This paper presents a new adaptive PC-Kriging (APCK) approach to accurately and efficiently assess the time-variant reliabilities. Time interval is firstly discretized with a series of time instants and then the stochastic process is reconstructed by standard normal random variables and deterministic function of time. PC-Kriging (PCK) models are built at each time instant to predict the instantaneous responses of performance function. To improve the accuracy and efficiency, a new update strategy based on the integration of U-and H-learning functions is developed to refine the PCK models of instantaneous responses. One or two best samples are identified by the proposed learning criterion for updating the PCK models. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is used to estimate the time-variant reliability based on the updated PCK models. Four examples are used to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.

AB  - Nowadays, cloud computing has played a vital role in most data-intensive applications to store the data in the intermediated dataset. This effective cloud storage process helps to minimize the storage and processing cost while performing recomputing. Although the cloud provides numerous services, resources maintaining cost, outsourced user data protection from unauthorized users, the privacy of sensitive data, and computation complexity is still a major issue. A novel deep learning network-based frequent pattern mining model (DLFPM) is introduced to overcome these issues. Here, the presented method examines the frequent access information according to the layers of network functions. The network computes the sensitive information from the deep learning function. The identified sensitivity information is encrypted using the single sign-on associated with the Paillier encryption technique (SSO-PE) that avoids unauthorized access. The effective utilization of these algorithms continuously manages the sensitive data security that helps to minimize the computation cost and computation time.

AB  - Robustness issue is considered to be one of the major concerns in application of the iterative learning control in motion control systems. The robustness in servo systems is related to parameter uncertainties and noise accumulation. In this paper, both parameter uncertainties and noise are considered in derivation of the error dynamic equation of the ILC algorithm. Based on the error dynamics, the H-infinity framework is utilized to design the robust learning controller. An optimization design process in selecting the proper learning gain and determining the learning function is proposed to ensure that both tracking performance and convergence condition are achieved. Simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the robust learning algorithm which can be applied efficiently to machine tools with the payload varying from 0 to 20 kg. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the tracking and contouring performances significantly when performing a complex NURBS curve on a three-axis milling machine.

Compared with traditional method, the proposed method has certain anti-disturbance ability and self-adaptability. Also, the proposed method is convenient for engineering application, which ensures both the real-time performance and stability of the algorithm.

AB  - Hybrid dynamical systems have steadily grown in popularity over the last few decades because they ease the task of modeling complicated nonlinear systems. However, it can be challenging to apply pre-existing control strategies to hybrid systems. This is in part because hybrid systems have been difficult to represent in closed-form, which is necessary for executing the operations required for many controllers' synthesis. The primary contribution of this work is a general closedform state space representation of piecewise defined systems, a class of hybrid systems. The utility of this representation is demonstrated via the first-ever application of iterative learning control to a hybrid system, which is accomplished without modifying the controller design to account for the system model's hybrid nature. Secondary contributions unrelated to system's hybrid nature, however, are made to the controller itself, formalizing it for application to systems of any relative degree, and enabling the direct application of Newton's method in the controller by using automatic differentiation in the learning function derivation.

T2  - 2019 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ACC)
CP  - American Control Conference (ACC)
AB  - Soft robotics has shown great potential in manipulation and human-robot interaction due to its compliant nature. However, soft systems usually have a large degree of freedom and strong nonlinearities, which pose significant challenges for precise modeling and control. In this paper, a linear parameter-varying (LPV) model is developed to describe the dynamics of a soft robotic arm segment. Given the different actuation mechanisms, the LPV models for elongation and bending motions are identified through experimental data. A state-feedback H-infinity controller is designed for the LPV model using a linear matrix inequality (LMI). Simulation of the state-feedback controller indicates that the closed-loop system is stable but with steady-state errors. As a result, an iterative learning control (ILC) with P-type learning function is implemented to improve the tracking performance. Simulation results of the ILC+state-feedback controller show steady-state errors are significantly reduced with iterations. The ILC+state-feedback controller successfully moves the soft robotic arm segment to its desired position within several iterations in experiments.

AB  - Discriminative correlation filters (DCFs) have been widely used in the visual tracking community in recent years. The DCFs-based trackers determine the target location through a response map generated by the correlation filters and determine the target scale by a fixed scale factor. However, the response map is vulnerable to noise interference and the fixed scale factor also cannot reflect the real scale change of the target, which can obviously reduce the tracking performance. In this paper, to solve the aforementioned drawbacks, we propose to learn a metric learning model in correlation filters framework for visual tracking (called CFML). This model can use a metric learning function to solve the target scale problem. In particular, we adopt a hard negative mining strategy to alleviate the influence of the noise on the response map, which can effectively improve the tracking accuracy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CFML tracker achieves competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art trackers. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial intelligence plays an essential role in the medical and health industries. Deep convolution networks offer valuable services and help create automated systems to perform medical image analysis. However, convolution networks examine medical images effectively; such systems require high computational complexity when recognizing the same disease-affected region. Therefore, an optimized deep convolution network is utilized for analyzing disease-affected regions in this work. Different disease-related medical images are selected and examined pixel by pixel; this analysis uses the gray wolf optimized deep learning network. This method identifies affected pixels by the gray wolf hunting process. The convolution network uses an automatic learning function that predicts the disease affected by previous imaging analysis. The optimized algorithm-based selected regions are further examined using the distribution pattern-matching rule.

AB  - Active learning Kriging model-based Monte Carlo simulation (AK-MCS) is a powerful reliability analysis method. However, the AK-MCS is time-consuming due to the large size of sample pool under the analysis of a rare failure event. Therefore, an efficient reliability analysis method combining with the active learning Kriging model and Subset simulation (SS) is proposed in this research. In the proposed strategy, the failure probability is transformed as the product of a series of larger conditional probability of the adaptively selected intermediate failure events. The approximated models of these limit state surfaces are accurately constructed by a novel active learning Kriging model in the proposed method. By the new learning function extracted from the variance of the corresponding conditional failure probability, the accuracy of the corresponding approximated model can efficiently improve. The proposed method can significantly reduce the calculational burden of evaluating the actual complicated performance function compared with AK-MCS. Two examples are employed to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.

AB  - In this paper, a novel MRGP-SS method is proposed to deal with the reliability analysis problems under multiple failure modes. First, a random moving quadrilateral grid sampling (RMQGS) method is proposed to improve the randomness and uniformity of initial samples. Second, an adaptive procedure, which combines the multiple response Gaussian process (MRGP) model and the novel active learning functions, is proposed to efficiently and accurately produce surrogate models for failure surfaces. In this regard, two novel learning functions are introduced to adapt to different iterative cycles, one is employed to correct the quality of samples, and the other is used to search for the samples closest to the limit state surface. Third, the subset simulation (SS) is integrated into the adaptive MRGP model to estimate the failure probability under multiple failure modes with fewer function calls and time consumption. Numerical and engineering case studies are finally provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

KW  - Active learning

AB  - The goal of feature selection is to identify the most informative features for compact representation, whereas the goal of active learning is to select the most informative instances for prediction. Previous studies separately address these two problems, despite of the fact that selecting features and instances are dual operations over a data matrix. In this paper, we consider the novel problem of simultaneously selecting the most informative features and instances and develop a solution from the perspective of optimum experimental design. That is, by using the selected features as the new representation and the selected instances as training data, the variance of the parameter estimate of a learning function can be minimized. Specifically, we propose a novel approach, which is called Unified criterion for Feature and Instance selection (UFI), to simultaneously identify the most informative features and instances that minimize the trace of the parameter covariance matrix. A greedy algorithm is introduced to efficiently solve the optimization problem. Experimental results on two benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

AB  - The problem of learning universally quantified function free first order Horn expressions is studied. Several models of learning from equivalence and membership queries are considered, including the model where interpretations are examples (Learning from Interpretations), the model where clauses are examples (Learning from Entailment), models where extensional or intentional background knowledge is given to the learner (as done in Inductive Logic Programming), and the model where the reasoning performance of the learner rather than identification is of interest (Learning to Reason). We present learning algorithms for all these tasks for the class of universally quantified function free Horn expressions. The algorithms are polynomial in the number of predicate symbols in the language and the number of clauses in the target Horn expression but exponential in the arity of predicates and the number of universally quantified variables. We also provide lower bounds for these tasks by way of characterising the VC-dimension of this class of expressions. The exponential dependence on the number of variables is the main gap between the lower and upper bounds.

AB  - Machine-learning function representations such as neural networks have proven to be excellent constructs for constitutive modeling due to their flexibility to represent highly nonlinear data and their ability to incorporate constitutive constraints, which also allows them to generalize well to unseen data. In this work, we extend a polyconvex hyperelastic neural network framework to (isotropic) thermo-hyperelasticity by specifying the thermodynamic and material theoretic requirements for an expansion of the Helmholtz free energy expressed in terms of deformation invariants and temperature. Different formulations which a priori ensure polyconvexity with respect to deformation and concavity with respect to temperature are proposed and discussed. The physics-augmented neural networks are furthermore calibrated with a recently proposed sparsification algorithm that not only aims to fit the training data but also penalizes the number of active parameters, which prevents overfitting in the low data regime and promotes generalization. The performance of the proposed framework is demonstrated on synthetic data, which illustrate the expected thermomechanical phenomena, and existing temperature-dependent uniaxial tension and tension-torsion experimental datasets.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a model predictive control (MPC) technique combined with iterative learning control (ILC), called the iterative learning model predictive control (ILMPC), for constrained multivariable control of batch processes. Although the general ILC makes the outputs converge to reference trajectories under model uncertainty, it uses open-loop control within a batch; thus, it cannot reject real-time disturbances. The MPC algorithm shows identical performance for all batches, and it highly depends on model quality because it does not use previous batch information. We integrate the advantages of the two algorithms. The proposed ILMPC formulation is based on general MPC and incorporates an iterative learning function into MPC. Thus, it is easy to handle various issues for which the general MPC is suitable, such as constraints, time-varying systems, disturbances, and stochastic characteristics. Simulation examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed ILMPC. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Programmatic assessment is an integral approach to the design of an assessment program with the intent to optimise its learning function, its decision-making function and its curriculum quality-assurance function. Individual methods of assessment, purposefully chosen for their alignment with the curriculum outcomes and their information value for the learner, the teacher and the organisation, are seen as individual data points. The information value of these individual data points is maximised by giving feedback to the learner. There is a decoupling of assessment moment and decision moment. Intermediate and high-stakes decisions are based on multiple data points after a meaningful aggregation of information and supported by rigorous organisational procedures to ensure their dependability. Self-regulation of learning, through analysis of the assessment information and the attainment of the ensuing learning goals, is scaffolded by a mentoring system. Programmatic assessment-for-learning can be applied to any part of the training continuum, provided that the underlying learning conception is constructivist. This paper provides concrete recommendations for implementation of programmatic assessment.

AB  - The effects of advanced age and cognitive resources on the course of skill acquisition are unclear, and discrepancies among studies may reflect limitations of data analytic approaches. We applied a multilevel negative exponential model to skill acquisition data from 80 trials (four 20-trial blocks) of a pursuit rotor task administered to healthy adults (19-80 years old). The analyses conducted at the single-trial level indicated that the negative exponential function described performance well. Learning parameters correlated with measures of task-relevant cognitive resources on all blocks except the last and with age on all blocks after the second. Thus, age differences in motor skill acquisition may evolve in 2 phases: In the first, age differences are collinear with individual differences in task-relevant cognitive resources; in the second, age differences orthogonal to these resources emerge.

AB  - In order to realize intelligent agent such as autonomous mobile robots, Reinforcement Learning is one of the necessary techniques in control system. Fuzzy Q-learning is one of the promising approaches for implementation of reinforcement learning function owing to its high ability of model representation. However, in applying fuzzy Q-learning to actual application, the number of iterations for learning also becomes huge as well as almost all Q-learning application. Furthermore convergence performance is often deteriorated owing to its complicated model structure. In this study, implementation method of fuzzy Q-learning is discussed in order to improve the learning performance of fuzzy Q-learning. The modular fuzzy model construction method based on fuzzy Q-learning is proposed in this paper. Multi-grain configuration of modular fuzzy model is compared with parallel structured learning scheme. Through numerical experiments of mountain car task and Acrobot task, I found that the proposed construction of modular fuzzy model improved the performance of fuzzy Q-learning.

AB  - Despite recent advancements in adaptive Kriging-based reliability analysis for complex limit states, estimation of the accuracy of extant techniques when the true failure probability is unknown remains an important challenge. The present study addresses this gap by developing analytical confidence intervals (CIs) for failure probability estimates. This is facilitated here by leveraging statistical properties of Poisson Binomial distribution for the expected number of failure points in the set of candidate design samples in adaptive Kriging as well as Lindeberg's condition for central limit theorem. Concerning computational demands involved in the computation of CIs, a simpler case where Kriging correlations are neglected is also derived. The performance of the proposed CIs is subsequently analyzed for five examples with different and varying complexities. Results indicate that the proposed CI with correlations considered offers the most accurate intervals. Additionally, whereas the CI estimated without Kriging correlation is not entirely satisfactory at early-stages of adaptive reliability analysis, it converges to accurate bounds at later stages.

AB  - We propose a supervised learning model that enables error backpropagation for spiking neural network hardware. The method is modeled by modifying an existing model to suit the hardware implementation. An example of a network circuit for the model is also presented. In this circuit, a three-terminal ferroelectric memristor (3T-FeMEM), which is a field-effect transistor with a gate insulator composed of ferroelectric materials, is used as an electric synapse device to store the analog synaptic weight. Our model can be implemented by reflecting the network error to the write voltage of the 3T-FeMEMs and introducing a spike-timing-dependent learning function to the device. An XOR problem was successfully demonstrated as a benchmark learning by numerical simulations using the circuit properties to estimate the learning performance. In principle, the learning time per step of this supervised learning model and the circuit is independent of the number of neurons in each layer, promising a high-speed and low-power calculation in large-scale neural networks.

AB  - AODV routing algorithm is widely used in a large-scale outdoor area for ZigBee wireless sensors networks. However, a large number of routing requests in AODV algorithm can easily lead to broadcast storms, which consume a lot of bandwidth and node energy, cause a large amount of signal collision and reduce the quality of communication. To solve these problems, this paper proposes self-learning multi-route selection-optimised algorithm (SMSA) based on improvements of ZigBee AODV. By making full use of the learning function of the routing table and taking collision frequency of sending data as a reference index of the cost of the path, this algorithm can reduce effectively the number of forwarding RREQ, inhibit the broadcast storm and reduce the collision of data, thus improving the success rate of data transmission. Meanwhile, it can also reduce the transmission delay and eventually save the overall energy of the network. In the simulation platform of OMNeT++, the algorithm proves to have a good effect on the large scale ZigBee network.

AB  - The Self-organizing Maps, proposed by Kohonen, have been used with a great deal of success in many applications. However, the basic SOM is designed to map patterns, or feature vectors, from an input space into an output space and does not take time into account. Speech recognition is a sequence of acoustic information and can't be considered as a static vector of information. In order to classify temporal sequences we present in this paper how to use spiking neurons for unsupervised competitive learning, preserving self-organizing maps. In fact we present two variants of SOM, the Leaky Integrators Neurons and the Spiking_SOM models. The Leaky Integrators Neurons model is based on the conservation of information, which makes it possible to consider the temporal order between the successive samples by using a mechanism called Leaky Integrators and the Spiking_SOM model preserves traditional model SOM, however it represents the characteristic to modify the learning function. The case study of the proposed models is phoneme classification in continuous speech.

AB  - A new intelligent adaptive control scheme was proposed that combines observer disturbance-based adaptive control and fuzzy adaptive control for a composite structure with a mass-adjustable damper. The most important advantage is that the control structures do not need to know the uncertainty limits and the interference effect is eliminated. Three adjustable parameters in LMI are used to control the gain of the 2D fuzzy control. Binary performance indices with weighted matrices are constructed to separately evaluate validation and training performance using the revalidation learning function. Determining the appropriate weight matrix balances control and learning efficiency and prevents large gains in control. It is proved that the stability of the control system can be ensured by a linear matrix theory of equality based on Lyapunov's theory. Simulation results show that the multilevel simulation approach combines accuracy with high computational efficiency. The M-TMD system, by slightly reducing critical joint load amplitudes, can significantly improve the overall response of an uncontrolled structure.

AB  - The traditional teaching quality evaluation model can only evaluate the data of the corresponding period, does not have the deep learning function, and cannot realize the prediction based on the existing data. In order to improve the operation effect of the teaching evaluation model, this study built a teaching evaluation model by combining data mining with deep learning and constructed a data processing module based on cloud computing. Moreover, this study used the improved incomplete multi-classification algorithm to construct the multi-divider and applied the constructed classifier to the teaching evaluation system to automatically classify the teachers. In addition, after learning the relevant theoretical knowledge of the university evaluation system, this paper also designed a prototype of the teaching quality evaluation framework based on the improved algorithm. Through the analysis of the model effect, it can be seen that the results of this study have certain evaluation effects, which can be applied to practice, and can provide theoretical reference for subsequent related research.

AB  - Calculating the throughput-time of a production run, when a learning effect influences task times, is a complicated but important problem of production management. Classical assembly line balancing techniques assume a constant cycle time. However, if a learning effect is present, cycle time changes for two main reasons. First, cycle time continuously decreases as the operation time of the bottleneck station decreases due to learning. Second, the bottleneck may shift from one station to another, causing further changes in the cycle time. This paper explores the effects of an exponential learning function on the operation of simple assembly lines. An algorithm is presented to determine throughput-time, and a sample problem is provided to illustrate the required calculations. The sensitivity of the throughput-time with respect to the learning rate is also examined, and some general conclusions related to the effect of learning rate changes are presented.

AB  - This article proposes a phase I/II clinical trial design for adaptively and dynamically optimizing each patient's dose in each of two cycles of therapy based on the joint binary efficacy and toxicity outcomes in each cycle. A dose-outcome model is assumed that includes a Bayesian hierarchical latent variable structure to induce association among the outcomes and also facilitate posterior computation. Doses are chosen in each cycle based on posteriors of a model-based objective function, similar to a reinforcement learning or Q-learning function, defined in terms of numerical utilities of the joint outcomes in each cycle. For each patient, the procedure outputs a sequence of two actions, one for each cycle, with each action being the decision to either treat the patient at a chosen dose or not to treat. The cycle 2 action depends on the individual patient's cycle 1 dose and outcomes. In addition, decisions are based on posterior inference using other patients' data, and therefore, the proposed method is adaptive both within and between patients. A simulation study of the method is presented, including comparison to two-cycle extensions of the conventional 3 + 3 algorithm, continual reassessment method, and a Bayesian model-based design, and evaluation of robustness.

AB  - In using the Kriging-based adaptive structure reliability analysis methods, the key is to select the appropriate method of adding samples adaptively. In this study, a new parallel adaptive structure reliability analysis method-Reliability Analysis Based on Importance sampling and K-medoids clustering (RBIK)-is proposed. On the basis of the influence of the Kriging model's cognitive uncertainty on the estimation accuracy of failure probability, a global convergence condition (GCC) is proposed. Then, to evaluate the GCC unbiased and efficiently, the optimal importance sampling function will be constructed and used to obtain candidate samples. Considering the spatial correlation of candidate samples, the clustering algorithm is used for the cluster analysis of candidate samples to realize the parallel operation of adaptive structural reliability analysis. Therefore, RBIK is proposed on the basis of importance sampling and K-medoids clustering. RBIK strives to rapidly enable the Kriging model to satisfy the GCC rather than focusing on a single candidate sample, which is the most obvious difference between RBIK and other adaptive structural reliability analysis methods. In addition, RBIK can balance parallel computing power, accuracy, and the number of iterations required. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of RBIK are proven by several examples.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING
AB  - As a complex system engineering, economic forecasting involves many fields and disciplines, and its accuracy largely depends on the selected forecasting method and forecasting model. The construction of the traditional economic prediction model mainly depends on the theories of economic statistics and metrology, which cannot meet the prediction needs of the new era. ANN model has a more flexible nonlinear quality and learning mode so that it can effectively adapt to the prediction scenario of a nonlinear economic system. ANN is an abstract model of the human brain neuronal network based on the information-processing perspective and composed of different networks to achieve a specific representation of logical strategies. ANN's self-learning function, associative storage function, and the ability to find optimal solutions at high speed have led to its in-depth application and research in an increasing number of fields. In addition, ANN research work has continued to advance, has made great progress in many fields represented by economic forecasting, has successfully solved many practical problems, showing a more intelligent adaptation in the field of economics, and therefore has an important research value. Based on this, this paper first analyzes the economic system prediction, then studies the ANN medium model and learning algorithm, and finally verifies the effectiveness of the ANN economic prediction model integrating computer medium.

The transfer functions for output layer were linear function. The optimal MSE of training process were 6.62E-09, 3.32E-09 and 3.02E-08. The MSE of the test were 7.19E-09, 3.21E-09 and 2.46E-08, respectively. This provides the optimal percentage of Efficiency Index in the testing process. It showed that the proposed ANFIS can be used in signal pattern recognition in order to analyze and classify between good and bad signals.

AB  - Possibility-based design optimization (PBDO) can provide theoretical basis for the structural optimal design of fuzzy uncertainty model in engineering, so as to obtain the optimal design variables. The genetic algorithm (GA) based on adaptive Kriging method for PBDO requires high precision in the whole design space, while the region far from the limit state surface (LSS) of the constraint function has little effect on PBDO, thus greatly affects the computational efficiency. In order to improve the efficiency of PBDO, an improved adaptive Kriging method combined with active possibility constraint (I-AK-AC) is proposed in this paper. In I-AK-AC, the enhanced expected improvement learning function is first put forward to promote the convergence efficiency of Kriging model by reducing the accuracy of the region far from the LSS of the constraint function. Whereafter, the active possibility constraint is identified, and only the boundaries of active possibility constraint need to be approximated precisely by Kriging model. By these ways, the convergence speed of Kriging model is further ameliorated without affecting the computational accuracy, and the efficiency of PBDO is significantly improved. Three test examples and an engineering application of aeroengine turbine disk illustrate the validity and accuracy of the proposed I-AK-AC.

AB  - The research aimed to model CO2 flux from soil to atmosphere in greenhouse conditions, using multiple linear regression (MLR) artificial neural networks (ANN), and deep learning neural networks (DLNN). Following the purpose, crop species, soil temperature, soil moisture content, photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), and soil oxygen exchange were considered as input parameters and CO2 flux as an output parameter. Levenberg-Marquardt learning function and logarithmic symmetric sigmoid transfer function were utilized in both ANN and DLNN. The optimal number of hidden layer neurons was determined through empirical observation, the model which produces the least mean absolute error value was chosen in each structure. Thus, ANN utilized 8 neurons, while DLNN utilized 14 neurons in the first hidden layer and 10 neurons in the second hidden layer. According to the result, CO2 flux from soil to atmosphere was modeled using MLR with an accuracy of 95.63%, ANN with an accuracy of 95.56% and DLNN with an accuracy of 98.29%. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for both models to determine the pro rota efficiency of the input parameters on CO2 flux. In the research, it was concluded that CO2 flux from soil to atmosphere can be modeled in high accuracy, and deep artificial neural networks can have higher efficiency in similar works.

AB  - A tradeoff between cost and safety is essential in the reliability-based design of offshore support structures operating in uncertain harsh environments. This study proposes a dependence-based double-loop optimization framework for complex structural systems under such environmental conditions. It considers the dependency of the environmental variables using a Drawable Vine (D-vine) copula. The reliability (inner loop of the design cycle) is modeled using the adaptive Polynomial Chaos Kriging (PCK) as a metamodel. The study employs a hybrid optimization approach that combines Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) in the outer loop optimization phase. The dependency effect is demonstrated on a steel column and a deep water segmented Steel Catenary Riser (SCR) at various hang angles to the offshore structure. The study shows the importance of multivariate dependence modeling in Reliability-Based Design Optimization (RBDO). It also highlights the significance of: (i) optimal copula selection, (ii) the impact of variable order in the D-vine copula's dependence tree, and (iii) the efficiency provided by the PCK metamodel. The method described in this paper provides a road map for a dependency-based optimal design of complex ocean structures. Also, it allows for strategic design decision-making under uncertainty, considering cost and safety.

AB  - The average lifetime or the mean time to failure (MTTF) of a product is an important metric to measure the product reliability. Current methods of evaluating the MTTF are mainly based on statistics or data. They need lifetime testing on a number of products to get the lifetime samples, which are then used to estimate the MTTF. The lifetime testing, however, is expensive in terms of both time and cost. The efficiency is also low because it cannot be effectively incorporated in the early design stage where many physics-based models are available. We propose to predict the MTTF in the design stage by means of a physics-based Gaussian process (GP) method. Since the physics-based models are usually computationally demanding, we face a problem with both big data (on the model input side) and small data (on the model output side). The proposed adaptive supervised training method with the Gaussian process regression can quickly predict the MTTF with a reduced number of physical model calls. The proposed method can enable continually improved design by changing design variables until reliability measures, including the MTTF, are satisfied. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by three examples.

AB  - Multiple failure modes tend to be identified in the reliability analysis of a redundant truss structure. This identification process involves updating the model for identifying the next potential failure members. Herein we intend to update the finite element model automatically in the identification process of failure modes and further perform the system reliability analysis efficiently. This study presents a framework that is implemented through the joint simulation of MATLAB and APDL and consists of three parts: reliability index of a single member, identification of dominant failure modes, and system-level reliability analysis for system reliability analysis of truss structures. Firstly, RSM (response surface method) combines with a constrained optimization model to calculate the reliability indices ofmembers. Then the ss-unzipping method is adopted to identify the dominant failuremodes, and the system function in MATLAB, as well as the EKILL command in APDL, is used to facilitate the automatic update of the finite element model and realize load-redistribution. Besides, the differential equivalence recursion algorithmis performed to approximate the reliability indices of failuremodes efficiently and accurately. Eventually, the PNET (probabilistic network evaluation technique) is used to calculate the joint failure probability as well as the system reliability index. Two illustrative examples demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed system reliability analysis framework through comparison with corresponding references.

AB  - Estimating the small failure probability of highly reliable structures, such as those used in aerospace, is challenging because of the large computational cost. In this paper, a new reliability analysis method that combines the improved dependent Kriging method and adaptive importance sampling for a small failure probability has been proposed. A Kriging model is constructed in each iteration, which avoids the complexity and time-consuming simulation. A new strategy for parallel learning is proposed to allow parallel computing and further reduce the overall computational time. The proposed method comprises the following strategies: (1) The importance sampling function is constructed adaptively to gradually approximate the optimal importance sampling function. (2) The learning function considers both the correlation among samples and the uncertainty contribution of samples to failure probability, with the ability to select multiple samples at each iteration to refine the Kriging model. (3) The stopping criterion is dependent on the expectation of the failure probability and converges at a fast rate. The proposed method can be applied to a system with a small failure probability, multiple failure regions, high nonlinearity, and implicit functions. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are demonstrated using four numerical examples and are compared with those of five competitive reported methods.

AB  - A new formulation on seismic risk assessment for structures with both random and uncertain-but-bounded variables is investigated in this paper. Limit thresholds are regarded as random variables. The median of random variables is described through an improved multidimensional parallelepiped (IMP) convex model, in which the uncertain domain of the dependent bounded variables can be explicitly expressed. The corresponding Engineering Demand Parameters are taken to be dependent and follow a multidimensional lognormal distribution. Through matrix transformation, a given performance function is transformed into the regularized one. An effective method based on active learning Kriging model (ALK) is introduced to approximate the performance function in the region of interest rather than in the overall uncertain space. Based on ALK model, the failure probabilities for different limit states are calculated by using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). Further, the failure probabilities for different limit states in 50 years can be obtained through coupling the seismic failure probability with the ground motion hazard curve. A six-story reinforced concrete building subjected to ground motions is investigated to the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method. The interstory drift and the acceleration as two responses of the case study are, respectively, obtained by utilizing Incremental Dynamic Analysis and nonlinear history analysis.

AB  - In this paper, the active learning Kriging model (ALK), which has been studied extensively in recent years, has been expanded by combining with the directional importance sampling (DIS) method. The directional sampling method can reduce the dimensionality of the variable space by random sampling or interpolation in the direction of vector diameter, which can improve the efficiency of reliability analysis. It is especially suitable for the surfaces whose limit state is spherical or near-spherical. By introducing the control coefficient and constructing the directional importance sampling density function, the sampling efficiency can be further improved in the design point domain. A novel reliability analysis method called ALK-DIS method is proposed. The greatest advantage of the proposed method is its ability on great computational efficiency and dealing with small failure probability problem In addition, due to the excellent performance of directional sampling method in dealing with multi-failure model reliability problems, the ALK-DIS method has the advantage of being applied to system reliability analysis in this paper successfully. The applicability, feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method are proved on examples which contain linearity equation, non-linear numerical example, non-linear oscillator and system reliability engineering problems.

AB  - Reliability-based design and optimization (RBDO) is increasingly critical for high-quality products. However, existing methods, such as active learning Kriging (ALK) and sequential optimization and reliability assessment (SORA), encounter challenges in efficiently and accurately handling complex nonlinear probabilistic constraints. This paper introduces a strategy for ALK called parallel adaptive candidate region (PACR), which leverages clustering methods (K-means or DBSCAN) inspired by machine learning. The novelty is that this method incorporates advanced techniques for RBDO, including quasi-sequence importance sampling (SIS) with a Markov chain based on quasi-samples obtained by ALK model. Another novelty is that a new learning function for reliability constraints, known as the influence factor function with a limit state constraints g(x) = 0 (IFG), has been used to simplify the calculation loop. The efficiency of the methods is validated through various mathematical tests. Then, a specific high-fidelity case study for a planetary roller screw mechanism (PRSM) is conducted to discover an optimal high-precision design with a reasonable load distribution under uncertain constraints. With our method, the standard deviation of the load sharing coefficient decreases by 35.90%, from 0.6221 to 0.3988, thereby affirming the effectiveness of our proposed approach in relatively complex nonlinear optimization problems with uncertain constraints.

AB  - Despite the existence of neural noise, which leads variability in motor commands, the central nervous system can effectively reduce movement variance at the end effector to meet task requirements. Although online correction based on feedback information is essential for reducing error, feedforward impedance control is another way to regulate motor variability. This Update Article reviews key studies examining the relation between task constraints and impedance control for human arm movement. When a smaller reaching target is given as a task constraint, flexor and extensor muscles are co-activated, and positional variance is decreased around the task constraint. Trial-by-trial muscle activations revealed no on-line feedback correction, indicating that humans are able to regulate their impedance in advance. These results demonstrate that not only on-line feedback correction, but also feedforward impedance control, helps reduce the motor variability caused by internal noise to realize dexterous movements of human arms. A computational model of movement planning considering the presence of signal-dependent noise provides a unifying framework that potentially accounts for optimizing impedance to maximize accuracy. A recently proposed learning algorism formulated as a V-shaped learning function explains how the central nervous system acquires impedance to optimize accuracy as well as stability and efficiency.

AB  - Since the Kriging model can provide the mean value of the performance function at a sample point and the corresponding variance among the various surrogate models, many Kriging-based reliability analysis methods have been developed to estimate accurate failure probabilities of engineering structure problems. Various active learning functions have been proposed to reduce the computation burden of Kriging-based reliability analysis for engineering problems. This paper proposes a new active learning Kriging-based method for estimating the failure probability. A penalty learning function is proposed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the failure probability estimate based on a simple penalty function. Also, a distance constraint term is considered to avoid a cluster of the selected sample points. Additionally, by an error-based stopping criterion, convergence conditions of the proposed new active learning reliability analysis method are investigated. Finally, five numerical examples are provided to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method and convergence strategy. Numerical results demonstrated that the novel proposed method significantly improves the computational efficiency of reliability analysis with high estimating accuracy of the failure probability.

AB  - This paper deals with fuzzy multi-objective multi-period portfolio selection problems. The portfolio selection is proposed by taking into account three criteria of final return, cumulative risk and entropy. In the model, the return level is quantified by the possibilistic mean value of return, and the risk is quantified by the possibilistic variance of return while fuzzy entropy is adopted to increase the risk dispersion degree to some extent. Then a fuzzy multi-objective multi-period portfolio model is presented in a more complex market environment. To solve the complex model, the multi-objective functions are transformed into a single objective and the risk preference parameter is introduced to balance the return and risk to meet with investors' preferences. To ensure the investor can obtain the optimal portfolio strategy, a hybrid intelligent algorithm is designed by combining both genetic algorithm and wavelet neural network algorithm, which not only utilizes the good localization property of wavelet transform but also utilizes the effective self-learning function of neural network. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate this approach and the designed algorithm. The results show that the proposed model and the designed algorithm are practical and flexible, while they are meaningful for the study on portfolio selection and multi-objective programming.

AB  - In practical engineering problems, accurate reliability assessment often is computationally expensive with time-consuming numerical models or simulation models. How to obtain an accurate reliability index with a fewer number of calls to original performance function in reliability analysis has become an important challenge. For the purpose of reducing the computational cost in reliability analysis, this work develops an adaptive failure boundary approximation method (AFBAM) by combining Kriging and uniform sampling with a new adaptive learning strategy. The proposed AFBAM makes full use of the binary classification feature of reliability analysis in the way that the failure boundary of the original model can be efficiently approximated. The number of experimental design samples is constantly updated by selecting informative samples with the proposed learning strategy. In order to ensure classification accuracy of the constructed Kriging model, a new stopping criterion is designed based on average misclassification probability and misclassification ratio. The proposed AFBAM technically makes reliability evaluation phase independent of adaptive iterative process, which greatly improves the efficiency of model refinement phase. At last, five examples involving nonlinearity problem, small failure probability problem and practical engineering problem are tested to verify the efficiency of the proposed AFBAM.

AB  - Sequential metamodel-based slope reliability analysis can significantly reduce the number of calls to a slope stability model, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. However, most existing methods rely on static candidate pools created by random sampling, either locally or globally, which often results in pools that are excessively large and lead to untargeted sampling. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel dynamic-candidate-pool-based sequential metamodel (DCP-SM) method for slope reliability analysis informed by an optimization methodology. This method optimally utilizes the information provided by a dynamically updated metamodel & Gcirc;T. Our recently proposed normal search particle swarm optimization algorithm is utilized to optimize |& Gcirc;T|. Solution sets that are evenly distributed and proximal to the predicted limit state function are used to construct a DCP. A novel sequential sampling strategy was proposed to identify the most informative points efficiently by taking full advantage of the characteristics of DCP. The efficacy of DCP-SM was validated by benchmarking it against nine state-of-the-art methods on three explicit performance functions and two typical examples of slope engineering. The results confirm the superiority of DCP-SM in terms of computational efficiency, accuracy, and stability.

AB  - One of the important challenges in structural reliability is using only a few function calls to obtain an accurate failure probability. To solve this problem, a combination of the adaptive Kriging method and Monte Carlo simulation (i.e., AK-MCS) has been proposed. However, AK-MCS may not be the most efficient method to estimate small failure probabilities because of the large candidate sample pool. This study proposes a new method that combines the reliability analysis method based on importance sampling and k-medoids clustering (RBIK) with subset simulation (SS) to estimate small failure probabilities. The proposed method replaces the MCS sample pool in RBIK with a smaller SS population to overcome the limitations of computer memory. Considering the influence of epistemic uncertainty on SS conditional samples, the conditional quasi-optimal importance distribution is derived. Then, a partial convergence condition (PCC) is introduced to control the estimation accuracy of failure probability. To accelerate the convergence of PCC, the parallel addition strategy based on the partial optimal importance sampling function and k-medoids method is presented. Finally, four examples (i.e., two numerical and two engineering examples) are studied. The results illustrate that RBIK-SS can solve rare failure events with satisfactory accuracy and efficiency.

AB  - Model updating techniques are often applied to calibrate the numerical models of bridges using structural health monitoring data. The updated models can facilitate damage assessment and prediction of responses under extreme loading conditions. Some researchers have adopted surrogate models, for example, Kriging approach, to reduce the computations, while others have quantified uncertainties with Bayesian inference. It is desirable to further improve the efficiency and robustness of the Kriging-based model updating approach and analytically evaluate its uncertainties. An active learning structural model updating method is proposed based on the Kriging method. The expected feasibility learning function is extended for model updating using a Bayesian objective function. The uncertainties can be quantified through a derived likelihood function. The case study for verification involves a multisensory vehicle-bridge system comprising only two sensors, with one installed on a vehicle parked temporarily on the bridge and another mounted directly on the bridge. The proposed algorithm is utilized for damage detection of two beams numerically and an aluminum model beam experimentally. The proposed method can achieve satisfactory accuracy in identifying damage with much less data, compared with the general Kriging model updating technique. Both the computation and instrumentation can be reduced for structural health monitoring and model updating.

AB  - In this paper, a prediction-oriented active sparse polynomial chaos expansion (PAS-PCE) is proposed for reli-ability analysis. Instead of leveraging on additional techniques to reduce the problem dimensionality and/or to obtain the local error estimates, which has been done in the majority of existing PCE-based methods, this study first makes use of the Bregman-iterative greedy coordinate descent in effectively solving the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator based regression for sparse PCE approximation with a small set of initial samples. Then, the local variance distribution of the performance function is predicted using the approximated PCE. By maximizing an optimality measure that balances the exploration of design space and exploitation of the PCE characteristics, a recently proposed learning function is subsequently adopted for selecting the optimal samples one by one from a candidate pool to cover the limit state surface regions proportionally to the predicted local variance. The performance of the proposed PAS-PCE is assessed on four numerical examples of varying complexity and input dimensionality through comparison with several state-of-the-art active learning methods based on a variety of surrogate models. Results show that the proposed method is superior to the benchmark algorithms in terms of both accuracy and efficiency for reliability analysis.

AB  - In this paper, we consider the problem of leader synchronization in systems with interacting agents in large networks while simultaneously satisfying energy-related user-defined distributed optimization criteria. But modeling in large networks is very difficult, and for that reason, we derive a model-free formulation that is based on a separate distributed Q-learning function for every agent. Every Q-function is a parametrization of each agent's control, of the neighborhood controls, and of the neighborhood tracking error. It is also evident that none of the agents has any information on where the leader is connected to and from where she spreads the desired information. The proposed algorithm uses an integral reinforcement learning approach with a separate distributed actor/critic network for each agent: a critic approximator to approximate each value function and an actor approximator to approximate each optimal control law. The derived tuning laws for each actor and critic approximators are designed appropriately by using gradient descent laws. We provide rigorous stability and convergence proofs to show that the closed-loop system has an asymptotically stable equilibrium point and that the control policies form a graphical Nash equilibrium. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a network consisting of 10 agents. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In active learning Kriging (AK) reliability-based analysis, a surrogate model is trained in a stepwise manner and used to evaluate the reliability of the desired system by reducing the computational cost of analysis. While extensive studies were conducted on advancing the AK reliability methods by developing new learning functions, limited work studied the effect of AK configuration on the accuracy, efficiency, and consistency of the AK reliability analysis. AK configuration is defined herein as a unique set of Kriging correlation, Kriging regression, learning function, and AK reliability method for the AK procedure. This paper presents six metric systems to evaluate the performance of AK reliability analysis based on AK configurations including the comprehensive metric system (CMS), the weighted metric system (WMS) with local optimized weights or average optimized weights (LOW or AOW), and modified desirability function, and two original desirability functions used for multiple response optimization. The ranking optimizes four scaled indexes as measures of accuracy, efficiency, and consistency of the reliability analysis. The metrics are developed and applied to four diverse examples, where a total of 14,400 AK reliability analyses were considered. The results show the validity of the metric systems to rank AK configurations based on their performance.

AB  - Based on the vibration control characteristics of self-developed piezoelectric friction damper(PFD), a semi-active fuzzy neural network control(FNNC) system for space bar structure is designed by using the relative displacement and relative velocity of the two ends of the bar as input and the control current as output. Firstly, Linear quadratic regulator(LQR) method is used for active control of the structure to obtain training data samples, and then the adaptive learning function of the neural network is used for fuzzy division and fuzzy rules. Finally, the inference ability of the fuzzy system is used to simulate the semi-active control of a space truss structure model based on seismic response. The simulation results show that the semi-active control effect of fuzzy neural network seismic response on space bar structure is obvious by using PFD. Finally, based on the FNNC strategy, the semi-active control test of the transmission tower model structure is realized. The experimental results show that the semi-active control of the transmission tower model structure by the damper can reduce the seismic response of the structure as a whole, which lay a foundation for further research on semi-active vibration control of piezoelectric friction dampers.

AB  - In engineering applications, the Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm with high rejection rates is employed to evaluate implicit response functions, making reliability analysis for small failure probabilities with multiple input random variables difficult and inefficient. To address the challenge and estimate highly nonlinear limit state functions in a more efficient and accurate way, a novel reliability analysis method based on the adaptive Kriging model and improved Metropolis-Hastings Importance Sampling (iMHIS) algorithm is proposed in this study, especially for the small failure probabilities with multiple input random variables. Based on the global error of the Kriging model, a new sub-optimal Importance Sampling Probability Density Function (ISPDF) is first developed, which aims at exploring failure bounds in a more accurate way. The iMHIS algorithm is developed to efficiently establish the candidate sample pool. A novel active learning function called the improved Expected Feasibility Improvement Function (iEFIF) is developed to select update points in a more accurate way, where the influence of the scattering geometry of candidate points is considered. A novel error-based stopping criterion is finally developed and implemented to avoid pre-mature or late-mature for small failure probabilities. Three relevant examples and two advanced finite element analysis examples are investigated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - In parallel mechanisms, joint clearance is an important factor affecting their dynamic characteristics. Particularly, the coupling effect of clearance joints and uncertain parameters can further deteriorate the performance of parallel mechanisms. Therefore, the dynamic characteristics and reliability analysis of parallel mechanism with clearance joints and uncertain parameters need to be studied. Combining the strengths of metamodeling and adaptive sequential sampling techniques, an efficient research framework for analyzing the dynamic reliability of spatially parallel mechanisms with clearance joints and uncertain parameters is developed. It can quantify the propagation of parameter uncertainties in dynamical systems and perform dynamic reliability assessment accurately and in real time. Clearance size and driving speed are described as random uncertain parameters, and the dynamic response reliability model of 4-UPS/RPS spatial parallel mechanism with clearance joints and uncertain parameters has been developed by meta-modeling method. The metamodel is updated adaptively by using an active learning function. Effects of clearance size and driving speed on dynamic characteristics and reliability of the mechanism system are evaluated and analyzed. This study can not only be used to optimize the design parameters of parallel mechanisms, but also can provide reference for dynamic reliability modeling and analysis of other mechanisms.

AB  - A latent variable iterative learning model predictive control (LV-ILMPC) method is presented for trajectory tracking in batch processes. Different from the iterative learning model predictive control (ILMPC) model built from the original variable space, LV-ILMPC develops a latent variable model based on dynamic partial least squares (DyPLS) to capture the dominant features of each batch. In each latent variable space, we use a state-space model to describe the dynamic characteristics of the internal model, and an LV-ILMPC controller is designed. Each LV-ILMPC controller tracks the set points of the current batch projection in the corresponding latent variable space, and the optimal control law is determined and the persistent process disturbances is rejected along both time and batch horizons. The proposed LV-ILMPC formulation is based on general LV-MPC and incorporates an iterative learning function into LV-MPC. In addition, the real physical input that drives the process can be reconstructed from the latent variable space. Therefore, this algorithm is particularly suitable for multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) systems with strong coupling and serious collinearity. Three studies are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed LV-ILMPC . (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

KW  - Robust optimisation

KW  - Efficient global optimisation
AB  - Design optimization is common practice in engineering where the goal is to find the optimal combination of design parameters under prescribed constraints. However, some parameters may be impossible to define in a deterministic sense and may only be known with significant uncertainty. This limitation has led to an alternative definition of design optimality called robustness, where attention is payed to the variation around the optimal performance. Straightforward methods to solve robust optimization problems are usually limited in two ways: (1) the computation burden of the so-called 'double-loop' opti-mization problem hinders application to realistic models, and (2) the formalisms are typically limited to probabilistic descriptions of the uncertainty. This paper presents a formulation of the robust optimization problem under interval uncertainty and proposes a new approach taking advantage of the so-called adap-tive Gaussian processes to solve it efficiently. The proposed surrogate approach mitigates the computa-tional burden of the resolution, and a dedicated learning function is proposed to ensure iterative minimization of the surrogate modelling error and convergence towards the robust optimum. The algo-rithm uses a stopping criterion related to the level of confidence associated with the optimality of the solution. The approach is illustrated on six analytical and engineering benchmark problems. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The reliability and sensitivity analyses of stator blade regulator usually involve complex characteristics like high-nonlinearity, multi-failure regions, and small failure probability, which brings in unacceptable computing efficiency and accuracy of the current analysis methods. In this case, by fitting the implicit limit state function (LSF) with active Kriging (AK) model and reducing candidate sample pool with adaptive importance sampling (AIS), a novel AK-AIS method is proposed. Herein, the AK model and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) are first established to identify the most probable failure region(s) (MPFRs), and the adaptive kernel density estimation (AKDE) importance sampling function is constructed to select the candidate samples. With the best samples sequentially attained in the reduced candidate samples and employed to update the Kriging-fitted LSF, the failure probability and sensitivity indices are acquired at a lower cost. The proposed method is verified by two multi-failure numerical examples, and then applied to the reliability and sensitivity analyses of a typical stator blade regulator. With methods comparison, the proposed AK-AIS is proven to hold the computing advantages on accuracy and efficiency in complex reliability and sensitivity analysis problems.

AB  - Time-dependent reliability analysis remains challenging in practical engineering applications, since the modeling and solution are complicated, resulting in the huge computational burden. The composite limit state (CLS) method can efficiently reduce the computational cost to a certain extent. However, the computational cost is still high. In this article, an improved composite limit state (ICLS) method is proposed for efficient time-dependent reliability analysis, which is based on the original CLS. We propose two enhancements to improve the efficiency of the ICLS approach. First, different from the original method, Kriging surrogate models at all time nodes and one CLS Kriging surrogate model are established in the ICLS method, respectively. In that case, once a new sample is selected, there is no need to evaluate the true limit state function values on the new sample at each time node, leading to a reduction in computational cost. Next, the efficiency is further improved by updating the CLS Kriging surrogate model and the surrogate model at one selected time node simultaneously. Four examples are utilized to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the ICLS method for time-dependent reliability analysis.

AB  - Scheduling with learning effects has received a lot of research attention lately. By learning effect, we mean that job processing times can be shortened through the repeated processing of similar tasks. On the other hand, different entities (agents) interact to perform their respective tasks, negotiating among one another for the usage of common resources over time. However, research in the multi-agent setting is relatively limited. Meanwhile, the actual processing time of a job under an uncontrolled learning effect will drop to zero precipitously as the number of jobs increases or a job with a long processing time exists. Motivated by these observations, we consider a two-agent scheduling problem in which the actual processing time of a job in a schedule is a function of the sum-of-processing-times-based learning and a control parameter of the learning function. The objective is to minimize the total weighted completion time of the jobs of the first agent with the restriction that no tardy job is allowed for the second agent. We develop a branch-and-bound and three simulated annealing algorithms to solve the problem. Computational results show that the proposed algorithms are efficient in producing near-optimal solutions.

AB  - Improving hit rates can be achieved by enhancing cache replacement algorithms with the identification of zero-reuse objects (ZROs) and inserting them at the end of the cache queue. Note that the promotion policy needs to achieve a similar task as the above insertion policy since the hit object may immediately become a ZRO (called P-ZRO) that is not suitable for placement at the front of the queue. However, existing studies have yet to consider P-ZROs, and current insertion algorithms struggle to simultaneously identify both ZROs and P-ZROs. To address these issues, we propose integrating the insertion and promotion policies. We do this by treating hit objects as special missing objects and employing reinforcement learning to create a unified model for both policies, where the learning function recognizes the relationship between performance changes and the emergence of ZROs and P-ZROs. Our proposed solution is a smart cache insertion and promotion policy (SCIP) that dynamically adjusts the insertion position using a bimodal insertion policy for both missing and hit objects, guided by the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SCIP significantly improves overall performance in real-world content delivery network systems and outperforms state-of-the-art insertion policies in terms of miss ratios in the simulator. In addition, deploying SCIP on optimal cache replacement algorithms can further decrease their miss ratios.

AB  - Due to lack of sufficient data and information in engineering practice, it is often difficult to obtain precise probability distributions of some uncertain variables and parameters in reliability-based design optimization (RBDO). In this paper, distributional probability-box (p-box) model is employed to quantify these uncertain variables and parameters. To reduce the computational cost in RBDO associated with expensive and time-consuming constraints, an active learning Kriging-assisted method is proposed. In this method, the sequential optimization and reliability assessment (SORA) method is extended for RBDO under distributional p-box model. Kriging metamodels are constructed to make the replacement of actual constraints. To remove unnecessary computational expense on constructing Kriging metamodels, a screening criterion is built and employed for the judgment of active constraints in RBDO. Then, an active learning function is defined to find out update samples, which are adopted for sequentially refining Kriging metamodel of each active constraint by focusing on its limit-state surface (LSS) around the most probable target point (MPTP) at the solution of SORA. Several examples, including a welded beam problem and a piezoelectric energy harvester design, are provided to test the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed active learning Kriging-assisted method.

AB  - Active-learning Kriging models have gained more and more popularity for structural reliability analysis (SRA) in recent years. Improving the efficiency of simulations while maintaining high accuracy is essential for building Kriging-based SRA approaches. In this article, we propose a novel active-learning Kriging reliability analysis method based on parallelized sampling considering budget allocation (ALK-PBA). A parallelized sampling strategy based on clustering and budget allocation is developed. The low-discrepancy candidate samples are employed to provide representative candidate samples, and the adaptive truncated region is applied to select samples of relative high probability density. Then, the method is used for clustering samples. After identifying clusters, ALK-PBA allocates new training samples to each cluster according to a chosen learning function. This process is repeated iteratively to renew the Kriging model. Several numerical cases have been evaluated using the proposed ALK-PBA, and the results have demonstrated its high accuracy and efficiency for SRA. Moreover, the proposed method is employed to simulate three performance functions of different dimensions under various learning functions, and recommendations for choosing learning functions for the discussed problems are provided in this article.

AB  - Complexity of today's engineering systems inevitably makes the computational simulation of their performance challenging and time-consuming. Since structural reliability analysis methods generally repeat such computational simulations, it is essential to reduce the number of function evaluations required to achieve reliable estimates. In research efforts to fulfill this aim, adaptive Kriging methods have gained significant interest because of desirable properties and accuracy of the surrogate model. A new adaptive Kriging approach proposed in this paper improves the efficiency of reliability analysis by incorporating the probabilistic density of the random variable space into the adaptive procedure of identifying the surrogate limit-state surface. In addition, samples distributed uniformly inside the n-ball domain are used as the candidate points to enrich the experimental design, and the best candidate for simulation is determined in terms of influence on the failure probability estimation. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed Probability-Adaptive Kriging in n-Ball (PAK-B-n) method are demonstrated by several reliability examples characterized by highly non-linear limit-state functions, small failure probability and multiple design points. The results confirm that the method facilitates convergence to the failure probability with a smaller number of function evaluations.

AB  - Piecewise growth models (PGMs) were used to estimate and model changes in the preliteracy skill development of kindergartners in a moderately sized school district in the Pacific Northwest. PGMs were applied to interrupted time-series (ITS) data that arose within the context of a response-to-intervention (RtI) instructional framework. During the kindergarten year, multiple literacy assessments were conducted and supplemental instruction was initiated with struggling readers to promote the attainment of literacy benchmark goals. The use of PGMs provided analytic flexibility to specify a discontinuous learning function and test a number of within- and between-group model parameters related to the evaluation of program efficacy. Results revealed a statistically significant linear increment in student learning following the onset of the intervention. However, absolute and relative gains in literacy performance were more modest during the second half of the academic year. Key issues in applying PGMs within the RH framework, including the coding of time functions and the interpretation of model results, are addressed.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel ontology based distributed personalized searching method. The user's information is distributed among the nodes in a peer-to-peer network to reduce the computational costs of the system. The user profile is modeled as a weighted concept hierarchy. We use weighing methods based on the user's surfing pattern to weigh the concepts in the reference ontology. The ontology is partitioned and each node learns a dimension of the user's interest using one partition, all partitions together form the user's profile. The system adapts itself to the changing interests of the user by means of aging. We use hierarchical neural networks to classify the documents into concepts in reference ontology. To overcome the problem of training in cases where insufficient documents are available for a particular concept and to increase the scalability we propose to use two different hierarchical neural network classifiers, each using a different learning function. Their beliefs are combined using Dempster-Shafer theory to eliminate any weaknesses in classification into concepts in the ontology. Our system has an overall performance improvement of around 20%.

AB  - This paper aims to solve the resonance failure probability and develop an effective method to estimate the effects of variables and failure modes on failure probability of axially functionally graded material (FGM) pipe conveying fluid. Correspondingly, the natural frequency of axially FGM pipes conveying fluid is calculated using the differential quadrature method (DQM). A variable sensitivity analysis (VSA) is introduced to measure the effect of each random variable, and a mode sensitivity analysis (MSA) is introduced to acquire the importance ranking of failure modes. Then, an active learning Kriging (ALK) method is established to calculate the resonance failure probability and sensitivity indices, which greatly improves the application of resonance reliability analysis for pipelines in engineering practice. Based on the resonance reliability analysis method, the effects of fluid velocity, volume fraction and fluid density of axially FGM pipe conveying fluid on resonance reliability are analyzed. The results demonstrate that the proposed method has great performance in the anti-resonance analysis of pipes conveying fluid.

AB  - In this paper, we propose POLAR, an attention-based CNN combined with one-shot learning for personalized article recommendation. Given a query, POLAR uses an attention-based CNN to estimate the relevance score between the query and related articles. The attention mechanism can help significantly improve the relevance estimation. For example, on AMiner, this can help achieve a +5.0% improvement in terms of NDCG@3. One more challenge in personalized article recommendation is how to collect statistically sufficient training data for a recommendation model. POLAR combines a one-shot learning function into the recommendation model, which further gains significant improvements. For example, on AMiner, with only 1.6 feedbacks on average, POLAR achieves 2.7% improvement by NDCG@3. We evaluate the proposed POLAR on three different datasets: AMiner, Patent, and RARD. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Recently, we have successfully deployed POLAR into AMiner as the recommendation engine for article recommendation, which further confirms the effectiveness of the proposed model.

AB  - This paper addresses the consensus problem of discrete-time multiagent systems (DTMASs), which are subject to input saturation and lack of the information of agent dynamics. In the previous works, the DTMASs with input saturation can achieve semiglobal consensus by utilizing the low gain feedback (LGF) method, but computing the LGF matrices by solving the modified algebraic Riccati equation requires the knowledge of agent dynamics. In this paper, motivated by the reinforcement learning method, we propose a model-free Q-learning algorithm to obtain the LGF matrices for the DTMASs achieving global consensus. Firstly, we define a Q-learning function and deduce a Q-learning Bellman equation, whose solution can work out the LGF matrix. Then, we develop an iterative Q-learning algorithm to obtain the LGF matrix without the requirement of the knowledge about agent dynamics. Moreover, the DTMASs can achieve global consensus. Lastly, some simulation results are proposed to validate the effectiveness of the Q-learning algorithm and show the effect on the rate of convergence from the initial states of agents and the input saturation limit.

AB  - We present a framework for understanding how the hippocampus, neocortex, and basal ganglia work together to support cognitive and behavioral function in the mammalian brain. This framework is based on computational tradeoffs that arise in neural network models, where achieving one type of learning function requires very different parameters from those necessary to achieve another form of learning. For example, we dissociate the hippocampus from cortex with respect to general levels of activity, learning rate, and level of overlap between activation patterns. Similarly, the frontal cortex and associated basal ganglia system have important neural specializations not required of the posterior cortex system. Taken together, this overall cognitive architecture, which has been implemented in functioning computational models, provides a rich and often subtle means of explaining a wide range of behavioral and cognitive neuroscience data. Here, we summarize recent results in the domains of recognition memory, contextual fear conditioning, effects of basal ganglia lesions on stimulus-response and place learning, and flexible responding.

AB  - The usefulness of a software product becomes obvious to consumers only after they get to experience it and, upon experiencing it, they may reach different conclusions regarding its true value. We examine the problem of designing free software trials under a general learning function. Our analyses lead to several new findings. We find that a time-locked trial is optimal only when the rate of learning is sufficiently large. It is not optimal in other situations, even when it has an overall positive effect on consumers' valuations. We also find that positive network effects have a minimal impact on this optimality. Interestingly, we find that neither the optimal trial period nor the optimal price is monotonically increasing in the rate of learning. At moderate rates, the software manufacturer pursues a dual strategy of offering a longer trial as well as a lower price. At higher rates of learning, the manufacturer does the opposite. Our results are robust, and incorporating possibilities such as a trial providing a signal of quality or learning being correlated with prior valuation has little impact on their applicability.

AB  - Spiking neural P systems (SN P systems) are a class of distributed and parallel neural-like computing models, inspired from the way neurons communicate by means of spikes. In this paper, a new variant of the systems, called SN P systems with learning functions, is introduced. Such systems can dynamically strengthen and weaken connections among neurons during the computation. A class of specific SN P systems with simple Hebbian learning function is constructed to recognize English letters. The experimental results show that the SN P systems achieve average accuracy rate 98.76% in the test case without noise. In the test cases with low, medium, and high noises, the SN P systems outperform back propagation neural networks and probabilistic neural networks. Moreover, comparing with spiking neural networks, SN P systems perform a little better in recognizing letters with noise. The result of this paper is promising in terms of the fact that it is the first attempt to use SN P systems in pattern recognition after many theoretical advancements of SN P systems, and SN P systems exhibit the feasibility for tackling pattern recognition problems.

TI  - A Two-Stage Active Learning Method for Learning to Rank
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
KW  - AREA
AB  - Learning to rank (L2R) algorithms use a labeled training set to generate a ranking model that can later be used to rank new query results. These training sets are costly and laborious to produce, requiring human annotators to assess the relevance or order of the documents in relation to a query. Active learning algorithms are able to reduce the labeling effort by selectively sampling an unlabeled set and choosing data instances that maximize a learning function's effectiveness. In this article, we propose a novel two-stage active learning method for L2R that combines and exploits interesting properties of its constituent parts, thus being effective and practical. In the first stage, an association rule active sampling algorithm is used to select a very small but effective initial training set. In the second stage, a query-by-committee strategy trained with the first-stage set is used to iteratively select more examples until a preset labeling budget is met or a target effectiveness is achieved. We test our method with various LETOR benchmarking data sets and compare it with several baselines to show that it achieves good results using only a small portion of the original training sets.

AB  - Users' daily activities, such as dining and shopping, inherently reflect their habits, intents and preferences, thus provide invaluable information for services such as personalized information recommendation and targeted advertising. Users' activity information, although ubiquitous on social media, has largely been unexploited. This paper addresses the task of user activity classification in microblogs, where users can publish short messages and maintain social networks online. We identify the importance of modeling a user's individuality, and that of exploiting opinions of the user's friends for accurate activity classification. In this light, we propose a novel collaborative boosting framework comprising a text-to-activity classifier for each user, and a mechanism for collaboration between classifiers of users having social connections. The collaboration between two classifiers includes exchanging their own training instances and their dynamically changing labeling decisions. We propose an iterative learning procedure that is formulated as gradient descent in learning function space, while opinion exchange between classifiers is implemented with a weighted voting in each learning iteration. We show through experiments that on real-world data from Sina Weibo, our method outperforms existing off-the-shelf algorithms that do not take users' individuality or social connections into account.

AB  - One of the main goals of Artificial Intelligence is to realizing an intelligent agent that behaves autonomously by its sense of value. Reinforcement learning (RL, in short) is the major learning mechanism for the agent to adapt itself to various situations of an unknown environment flexibly. The merit of RL is that the design cost is small. Only giving the agent a goal state as setting a reward, a set of optimal behavior sequences toward the goal state from each state can be learned by trial and error. However, in a multiagent system (MAS, in short) environment that has mutual dependency among agents, it is difficult for a human to setup suitable learning goals for each agent, besides the existent framework of RL that aims for objective and egoistic optimality is inadequate. Therefore, it requires the active and interactive learning function that treats how to coordinate the interaction among other learning agents. This paper presents a new framework of reinforcement learning to generate and coordinate the learning goals interactively among agents. Then coordinating conflict of interests among the agents is discussed to dissolve the social dilemma.

AB  - Reliability analysis for complex systems is a challenging problem, because of complex failure regions and frequently time-consuming simulations. Especially for complex systems with extremely rare events, it is of great significance to evaluate the reliability efficiently and accurately. Therefore, a novel reliability analysis method that combines the dependent Kriging method and adaptive spherical decomposition sampling for the rare event is proposed in this work to solve these problems. It makes full use of the mean and variance information of the Kriging predicted responses and the covariance information between the responses. In addition, the stopping criterion is directly related to the accuracy of failure probability rather than the accuracy of model construction. Furthermore, spherical decomposition sampling is used to estimate the small failure probability and improve sampling efficiency. Three test examples are presented to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. Meanwhile, the flap motion mechanism is used as the research object to verify the application of the proposed method.

AB  - Sub-pixel convolutional neural network is efficient for image super-resolution. However, the images generated are relatively smooth. Improving the learning ability of high-frequency features is of great significance for sub-pixel convolutional neural network to get better performance. In the paper, we propose an improved algorithm of sub-pixel convolutional neural network based on high-frequency feature learning for image super-resolution, it optimizes the traditional sub-pixel convolutional structure. Firstly we introduce a residual convolutional layer in the generation net. it assigns the residual factor to each sub-pixel feature map and forces each pixel feature map to adaptively use the input information. Furthermore, a method for high frequency feature mapping is proposed. During image super-resolution training stage, the multi-task learning function, combining the pixel-level loss function with high-frequency contrast loss function, make the generation images getting closer to the target super-resolution images in high-frequency domain. The experiments on CelebA dataset show that our proposed method can effectively improve the quality of super-resolution images by contrast to the traditional sub-pixel convolutional neural network.

AB  - Sound Event Detection (SED) tackles the challenge of identifying sound events in an audio recording by delimiting both their temporal boundaries as well as sound category. With recent advances in deep learning, current systems are able to leverage availability of large datasets to train sophisticated and highly effective SED models. Nonetheless, sound sources and acoustic characteristics of different classes vary greatly in their prevalence as well as representation in labeled datasets. The challenge with data imbalance in the case of SED stems not only from the representation (number of samples) across classes but also the natural asymmetry in time duration across different events varying from short transient events such as the clacking of dishes to more sustained events such as vacuuming. This variability results in an inherent disproportional representation of effective training samples. To address this compounded imbalance issue, this work proposes a balanced focal learning function that introduces a novel time-sensitive classwise weight. The proposed loss is applied to SED in the context of DCASE2021 challenge, and reports a notable improvement over the baseline, particularly in the case of shorter sound events.

AB  - In the field of reliability engineering, assessing the probability of failure of an event is usually a computationally demanding task. One way of tackling this issue is by metamodelling, in which the original computational-expensive model is approximated by a simpler metamodel. A method called AK-MCS for Active learning reliability method combining Kriging and Monte Carlo Simulation, was developed for the metamodel construction, and proved effective in reliability analysis. However, the performance of the AK-MCS algorithm is sensitive to the candidate size and the Kriging trend. Moreover, it cannot take advantage of parallel computing, a highly efficient way to speed up the simulation process. Focusing on the identified issues, this study proposes three methods to improve algorithm performance: the candidate size control method, multiple trends method, and weighted clustering method. These three methods are integrated into the AK-MCS structure, with their individual and combined performances being tested using four examples. Results suggest that all three methods contribute to the improvement of algorithm efficiency. When the three methods working together, the computational time is reduced significantly, and in the meantime, higher accuracy can be achieved.

AB  - For the reliability analysis with imprecise probability distributions, the failure probability and its sensitivity are always denoted as the functions of distribution parameters. The computation of those functional relationships remains a challenging task due to the intensive computational burden. To further improve the computational efficiency, this work proposes a new computational method based on the classical active learning Kriging model with U learning function. The Kriging model is constructed with a group of initial point and updated by the best contributing samples selected from different sample spaces corresponding to discrete distribution parameters, which guarantees the prediction ability in the variation range of distribution parameters. Consequently, the functions of failure probability and sensitivity can be estimated by the same Kriging model, which avoids re-constructing Kriging models corresponding to different distribution parameters. Several examples including two numerical examples and three engineering practices are investigated to validate the reasonability and superiority of the proposed method. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the fatigue life reliability and sensitivity analyses of a turbine disk structure.

AB  - The hydraulic excitation acting on a hydro-turbine generator unit exhibits obvious non-stationary characteristics. In order to account for these characteristics, this study focuses on the non-stationary random vibration reliability of the hydro-turbine generator unit. Firstly, the non-stationary characteristics of the hydraulic excitation are analyzed, and a mathematical expression is constructed using the virtual excitation method. Secondly, a dynamic model of the unit is established to demonstrate the non-stationary random vibration characteristics under hydraulic excitation. Thirdly, an active learning non-stationary vibration reliability analysis method AK-MCS-T-H is proposed combining the Kriging model, the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method, and the information entropy learning function H. This method reveals the influence of the non-stationary hydraulic excitation on the random vibration reliability of the hydro-turbine generator unit. Finally, an example is presented to analyze the random vibration reliability. The study shows that the AK-MCS-T-H proposed in this paper can solve the problem of non-stationary random vibration reliability of the Francis hydro-turbine generator unit more effectively.

AB  - Many models offer different explanations of learning processes, some of them predicting equal learning rates between conditions. The simplest method by which to assess this equality is to evaluate the curvature parameter for each condition, followed by a statistical test. However, this approach is highly dependent on the fitting procedure, which may come with built-in biases difficult to identify Averaging the data per block of training would help reduce the noise present in the trial data, but averaging introduces a severe distortion on the curve, which can no longer be fitted by the original function. In this article, we first demonstrate what is the distortion resulting from block averaging. The block average learning function, once known, can be used to extract parameters when the performance is averaged over blocks or sessions. The use of averages eliminates an important part of the noise present in the data and allows good recovery of the learning curve parameters. Equality of curvatures can be tested with a test of linear hypothesis. This method can be performed on trial data or block average data, but it is more powerful with block average data.

The merit of RL is that only giving the agent a goal state as setting a reward, a set of optimal behavior sequences toward the goal state from each state can be learned by trial and error. However, in a multiagent system environment that has mutual dependency among agents, it is difficult for a human to setup suitable learning goals for each agent, besides the existent framework of RL that aims for objective and egoistic optimality is inadequate. Therefore, it requires the active and interactive learning function that treats how to coordinate the interaction among other learning agents.
   This paper presents a new framework of multiagent reinforcement learning to generate and coordinate each learning goal interactively among agents. To realize this, it presents to treat each learning goal as a reinforcement signal that can be communicated among agents. Then the issues of the self-generation of goals and evaluation criteria are discussed.

AB  - This paper conducts the front wheel angle tracking compensation control of the electro-hydraulic coupling power steering system (EHCPS) of the intelligent heavy vehicle (IHV). It has been found from the results of mathematic analysis, simulation and open-loop frequency test of the EHCPS that front wheel angle slightly lags behind handwheel angle at low frequencies. In this paper, a kind of fuzzy neural network controller (FNNC) based on model reference adaptive control (MRAC) is designed. Fuzzy neural network is also used to identify the EHCPS on-line. Membership function and inference rules of the FNNC and fuzzy neural network identification (FNNI) are renewed by the self-learning function of neural network to achieve on-line regulation of controller's parameters. Reference model with certain bandwidth and control algorithm are designed to ensure that actual front wheel angle follows desired front wheel angle. Finally, the hardware-in-the-loop experiment and simulation results indicate that the control strategy presented in this paper is effective in compensating front wheel angle tracking within certain bandwidth of EHCPS.

KW  - REPRESENTATION
AB  - Pre-trained language models based on contrastive learning have shown to be effective in text classification. Despite its great success, contrastive learning still has some limitations. First, external linguistic knowledge has been shown to improve the performance of pre-trained language models, but how to use it in contrastive learning is still unclear. Second, general contrastive learning generates training samples with fixed data augmentation during the whole training period, while different augmentation methods are suitable for different downstream tasks. Fixed data augmentation can lead to suboptimal settings. In this paper, we propose contrastive learning based on linguistic knowledge and adaptive augmentation, which can obtain high-quality sentence representations to improve the performance of text classification. Specifically, we construct wordlevel positive and negative sample pairs by WordNet and propose a novel word-level contrastive learning function to inject linguistic knowledge. Then we dynamically select the augmentation policy by alignment and uniformity. This adaptive augmentation policy can acquire more generalized sentence representations with little computational overhead. Experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

KW  - Object tracking

AB  - Convolutional Siamese neural networks have been recently used to track objects using deep features. Siamese architecture can achieve real time speed, however it is still difficult to find a Siamese architecture that maintains the generalization capability, high accuracy and speed while decreasing the number of shared parameters especially when it is very deep. Furthermore, a conventional Siamese architecture usually processes one local neighborhood at a time, which makes the appearance model local and non-robust to appearance changes.
   To overcome these two problems, this paper proposes DensSiam, a novel convolutional Siamese architecture, which uses the concept of dense layers and connects each dense layer to all layers in a feed-forward fashion with a similarity-learning function. DensSiam also includes a Self-Attention mechanism to force the network to pay more attention to the non-local features during offline training. Extensive experiments are performed on four tracking benchmarks: OTB2013 and OTB2015 for validation set; and VOT2015, VOT2016 and VOT2017 for testing set. The obtained results show that DensSiam achieves superior results on these benchmarks compared to other current state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Noiseless coding algorithm based on cognitive processing of biometric data in system of digital identification of passengers
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE: INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES IN BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY
CP  - International Conference: Information Technologies in Business and Industry (ITBI)
AB  - The new approach to increasing the reliability and validity of the transmission of biometric information in the digital passenger identification system based on the use of noiseless coding algorithms with elements of cognitive data processing is presented in the article. Reed-Solomon non-binary codes as best suited for protecting digitized images are given to use in the proposed permutation decoding method data protection against errors. When integrating the cognitive map into the model of the permutation decoder, it is possible to implement the learning function. The training consists in that the decoder records the results of the transformations of the generating matrices of equivalent codes into the memory of a cognitive map using a ready solution under the conditions of permutations repetition. Thereby, a reduction in the volume of arithmetic calculations is achieved with use of only fast matrix transformations. The proposed method has a number of properties allowing one to reduce the e memory cognitive maps volume. The simulation results have shown that the implementation of the proposed method makes it possible to gain speeding up the calculations by reducing the number of operations.

AB  - In order to deal with high dimensional reliability analysis, an active learning method based on matrix-operation radial basis function (RBF) model is proposed in this paper. To accomplish active learning, the predicted mean and standard deviation of the RBF model need to be obtained with the help of leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV). When dealing with high dimensional problems, by LOOCV, the calculation of RBF matrix between candidate points and the training points, and the prediction of the sub-models at candidate points will be very time-consuming. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a matrix-operation method for RBF matrix calculation and a matrix-operation method for sub-model prediction. Such a matrix-operation RBF model significantly reduces the computation time of LOOCV and makes active learning mechanism possible. On this basis, we propose a novel learning function according to the prediction information of RBF model. In addition, the error-monitor mechanism is introduced to timely terminate the learning process. Four high-dimensional complex examples are investigated to verify the performance of the proposed method.

TI  - Rare bioparticle detection <i>via</i> deep metric learning
T2  - RSC ADVANCES
AB  - Recent deep neural networks have shown superb performance in analyzing bioimages for disease diagnosis and bioparticle classification. Conventional deep neural networks use simple classifiers such as SoftMax to obtain highly accurate results. However, they have limitations in many practical applications that require both low false alarm rate and high recovery rate, e.g., rare bioparticle detection, in which the representative image data is hard to collect, the training data is imbalanced, and the input images in inference time could be different from the training images. Deep metric learning offers a better generatability by using distance information to model the similarity of the images and learning function maps from image pixels to a latent space, playing a vital role in rare object detection. In this paper, we propose a robust model based on a deep metric neural network for rare bioparticle (Cryptosporidium or Giardia) detection in drinking water. Experimental results showed that the deep metric neural network achieved a high accuracy of 99.86% in classification, 98.89% in precision rate, 99.16% in recall rate and zero false alarm rate. The reported model empowers imaging flow cytometry with capabilities of biomedical diagnosis, environmental monitoring, and other biosensing applications.

AB  - Multilayer feedforward neural network (MFNN) trained by the backpropagation (BP) algorithm is one of the most significant models in artificial neural networks. MFNNs have been used in many areas of signal and image processing due to high applicability. Although they have been implemented as analog, mixed analog-digital and fully digital VLSI circuits, it is still difficult to realize their hardware implementation with the BP learning function efficiently. This paper describes a special BP algorithm for the logic oriented neural network (LOGO-NN) which we have proposed as a sort of MFNN with quantized weights and multilevel threshold neurons. Both weights and neuron outputs are quantized to integer values in LOGO-NNs. Furthermore, the proposed BP algorithm can reduce high precise calculations. Therefore, it is expected that LOGO-NNs with BP learning can be more effectively implemented as digital type circuits than the common MFNNs with the classical BP. Finally, it is shown by simulations that the proposed BP algorithm for LOGO-NNs has good performance in terms of the convergence rate, convergence speed and generalization capability.

AB  - With the high-level integration of mobile communication technology and information network technology, We the Media is proposed as a new concept in Dan Gillmor's book at this moment, and now has rapidly spread throughout the world. Meanwhile in the field of education, traditional learning models have been evolved from digitization to mobilization, then to miniaturization. Many experiments and statistics show that micro-learning can meet the learners' personal requirements, which proves micro-learning is a very effective informal learning form. As an open, equal and free information sharing platform, We the Media has brought new opportunities and developments for micro-learning. In this paper, we summarize the features of micro-learning and analyse the learning function of We the Media. Then we investigate the essence, problems, functions and applications of mobile micro-learning with We the Media. Based on that, we propose a mobile micro-learning form for undergraduates to explain how to use the popular platforms of We the Media such as WeChat, Microblog to organize study activities. We also provide some operable strategies for undergraduates to self-study in the mobile micro-learning form we proposed.

AB  - As a critical infrastructure for contemporary information technology industry, industrial internet of things (IIoT) contains a vast amount of sensitive data, making it a key requirement to ensure data security. As the use of wireless networks as a means of communication between nodes is becoming more and more common, in order to prevent malicious attacks from compromising the system, a zero-trust authentication system is necessary. In this article, we propose a comprehensive implementation framework for zero-trust verification of IIoT wireless transmission nodes, which utilizes federated learning to achieve zero-trust rule training and terminal model training, while employing blockchain technology for on-chain aggregation and cloud backup of the models. This approach enhances the accuracy and availability of the zero-trust rules while safeguarding the security of IIoT nodes. The constructed zero-trust framework incorporates a self-incremental learning function, and experiments show that it achieves a high level of accuracy at recognising attacks. Finally, we discuss the challenges of utilizing federated learning in zero-trust for IIoT and several potential solutions to address these challenges.

AB  - In this paper, we present a technique to tune the reinforcement learning (RL) parameters applied to the sequential ordering problem (SOP) using the Scott-Knott method. The RL has been widely recognized as a powerful tool for combinatorial optimization problems, such as travelling salesman and multidimensional knapsack problems. It seems, however, that less attention has been paid to solve the SOP. Here, we have developed a RL structure to solve the SOP that can partially fill that gap. Two traditional RL algorithms, Q-learning and SARSA, have been employed. Three learning specifications have been adopted to analyze the performance of the RL: algorithm type, reinforcement learning function, and epsilon parameter. A complete factorial experiment and the Scott-Knott method are used to find the best combination of factor levels, when the source of variation is statistically different in analysis of variance. The performance of the proposed RL has been tested using benchmarks from the TSPLIB library. In general, the selected parameters indicate that SARSA overwhelms the performance of Q-learning.

AB  - Background: Experiments were conducted to analyze environmental parameters and growth-related factors to identify the most influential factors in estimating pig's body weight (PBW) using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and multiple linear regression Back-propagation (FFBP) and Elman (EL) and MLR models were developed to estimate the body weight of pigs. The current research was conducted for 92 days during the two experimental periods (2021-2022) in a pig barn. Result: The Levenberg-Marquardt training function, gradient descent weight and bias learning function, tan-sigmoid transfer function and two hidden layers with 16 neurons in each layer were shown to be the most effective architecture of the FFBP model in predicting PBW. According to the sensitivity analysis, length of pig (LP) was the most influential factor in estimating the PBW for MLR/ANN models. However, the environmental parameters along with growth-related factors could not always be the same association with PBW. Therefore, further research on viable alternative breeds with different management conditions may be considered to evaluate MLR and ANN model's performance.

AB  - Up to date, the proposed clustering analysis methods are tremendous. In most of the methods, however, human-made determination like the number of clustering groups should be decided previously. Not only will the result be affected by the subjective point of view of the decision-maker, but also clustering efficiency is not good enough. To overcome these drawbacks, this research attempts to combine fuzzy sets theory with the unsupervised learning network model to create an unsupervised Fuzzy Self-Organizing Map (FSOM) model. This model integrates artificial neural network with fuzzy sets theory to take respective advantages of learning function and the capability of handling uncertainty problem in human recognition process. Generally, the fuzzy clustering analysis model developed in the research can completely explain the results from the experiments. Besides, this model seems more useful and practical than other clustering methods. The integration of FSOM and BPN networks to establish an intelligent decision support system can improve the problem of being unable to quickly analyze a new customer information and effectively response a suggestion to the decision maker.

KW  - Domain generalization
KW  - Adversarial networks
KW  - Domain invariant representation
AB  - Domain generalization aims to learn a classification model from multiple source domains and generalize it to unseen target domains. A critical problem in domain generalization involves learning domain-invariant representations. Let X and Y denote the features and the labels, respectively. Under the assumption that the conditional distribution P(Y vertical bar X) remains unchanged across domains, earlier approaches to domain generalization learned the invariant representation T(X) by minimizing the discrepancy of the marginal distribution P(T(X)). However, such an assumption of stable P(Y vertical bar X) does not necessarily hold in practice. In addition, the representation learning function T(X) is usually constrained to a simple linear transformation or shallow networks. To address the above two drawbacks, we propose an end-to-end conditional invariant deep domain generalization approach by leveraging deep neural networks for domain-invariant representation learning. The domain-invariance property is guaranteed through a conditional invariant adversarial network that can learn domain-invariant representations w.r.t. the joint distribution P(T(X), Y) if the target domain data are not severely class unbalanced. We perform various experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - The reliability analysis system is currently evolving, and reliability analysis efforts are also focusing more on correctness and efficiency. The effectiveness of the active learning Kriging metamodel for the investigation of structural system reliability has been demonstrated. In order to effectively predict failure probability, a semi-parallel active learning method based on Kriging (SPAK) is developed in this study. The process creates a novel learning function called U-A, which takes the correlation between training points and samples into account. The U-A function has been developed from the U function but is distinct from it. The U-A function improves the original U function, which pays too much attention to the area near the threshold and the accuracy of the surrogate model is improved. The semi-parallel learning method is then put forth, and it works since U-A and U functions are correlated. One or two training points will be added sparingly during the model learning iteration. It effectively lowers the required training points and iteration durations and increases the effectiveness of model building. Finally, three numerical examples and one engineering application are carried out to show the precision and effectiveness of the suggested method. In application, evaluation efficiency is increased by at least 14.5% and iteration efficiency increased by 35.7%. It can be found that the proposed algorithm is valuable for engineering applications.

AB  - For the time-variant hybrid reliability problem under random and interval uncertainties, the upper bound of time-variant failure probability, as a conservative index to quantify the safety level of the structure, is highly concerned. To efficiently estimate it, the adaptive Kriging respectively combined with design point based importance sampling and meta-model based one are proposed. The first algorithm firstly searches the design point of the hybrid problem, on which the candidate random samples are generated by shifting the sampling center from mean value to design point. Then, the Kriging model is iteratively trained and the hybrid problem is solved by the well-trained Kriging model. The second algorithm firstly utilizes the Kriging-based importance sampling to approximate the quasi optimal importance sampling samples and estimate the augmented upper bound of time-variant failure probability. After that, the Kriging model is further updated based on these importance samples to estimate the correction factor, on which the hybrid failure probability is calculated by the product of augmented upper bound of time-variant failure probability and correction factor. Meanwhile, an improved learning function is presented to efficiently train an accurate Kriging model. The proposed methods integrate the merits of adaptive Kriging and importance sampling, which can conduct the hybrid reliability analysis by as little as possible computational cost. The presented examples show the feasibility of the proposed methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T2  - KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
KW  - Sequential recommendation
KW  - Contrastive learning
KW  - Reinforcement learning
KW  - Intrinsic reward
AB  - Sequential recommendations play a crucial role in many real-world applications. Due to the sequential nature, reinforcement learning has been employed to iteratively produce recommendations based on an observed stream of user behavior. In this setting, a recommendation agent interacts with the environments (users) by sequentially recommending items (actions) to maximize users' overall long-term cumulative rewards. However, most reinforcement learning-based recommendation models only focus on extrinsic rewards based on user feedback, leading to sub-optimal policies if user-item interactions are sparse and fail to obtain the dynamic rewards based on the users' preferences. As a remedy, we propose a dynamic intrinsic reward signal integrated with a contrastive discriminator-augmented reinforcement learning framework. Concretely, our framework contains two modules: (1) a contrastive learning module is employed to learn the representation of item sequences; (2) an intrinsic reward learning function to imitate the user's internal dynamics. Furthermore, we combine static extrinsic reward and dynamic intrinsic reward to train a sequential recommender system based on double Q-learning. We integrate our framework with five representative sequential recommendation models. Specifically, our framework augments these recommendation models with two output layers: the supervised layer that applies cross-entropy loss to perform ranking and the other for reinforcement learning. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms several sequential recommendation baselines and exploration with intrinsic reward baselines.

AB  - Uncertainties widely existing in composite aircraft structures make flutter reliability and sensitivity analysis highly necessary. In this work, a probabilistic approach is proposed for reliability and sensitivity analysis of composite all-movable fin flutter. To be specific, an adaptive method based on basis-adaptive polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is developed to estimate the probability of failure, and the basis-adaptive PCE-based Sobol indices are used for measuring the contributions of input variables to the reliability over their entire uncertainty ranges. A composite beam and a composite plate are analyzed to test the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach. The finite element model of composite all-movable fin flutter is approximated by the basis-adaptive PCE model, which is adaptively updated by the FBR learning function. The weighed K-means strategy is added to accelerate the convergence speed and reduce the number of iterations. Then the basis-adaptive PCE model is combined with numerical simulation for reliability and sensitivity analysis of composite all-movable fin flutter. Based on the results of Monte Carlo simulation, compared with adaptive support vector regression, kriging, and the traditional PCE method, it is found that the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method are the best for reliability and sensitivity analysis of composite all-movable fin flutter.

AB  - Amphibious aircraft offer advantages in forest firefighting near coastal areas due to the maneuverability, precise delivery, and sufficient water source. However, when aircraft skim over the complex sea surfaces to scoop water, the fluid dynamics become highly unstable, resulting in an imbalance in water distribution on four tanks, which is susceptible to the design of water-bailing bucket and connecting tubes, so-called scooping system. In this study, the fluid-structural properties are investigated through transient one-way CFD analysis. Then the optimization design is conducted by introducing a novel active learning Kriging (ALK) model, which is coupled with parallel computing, novel constrained expected improvement (CEI) learning function and adaptive candidate region (ACR), to conduct the CFD transient analysis with an acceptable error. The results show that the optimal asymmetric design can reduce mass flow rate differences by 70.5 % and maximal von Mises stress by 23.1 %, while the values are 71.8 % and 20.9 % for symmetric design, respectively. Additionally, topological optimization for a simplified tube model reveals that the design of a spiral blade inside the tube can further enhance amphibious aircraft performance. This study offers valuable insights into the engineering of amphibious aircraft for maritime applications, laying the groundwork for future research endeavors.

AB  - To construct an optimal and reliable fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for magnetorheological (MR) damper-based structural systems, a reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) problem is formulated considering two competing objectives, namely, minimizing structural responses and control cost. This work incorporates a two-stage enrichment scheme with the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II)-based multi-objective optimization method to solve the RBDO problem. In the global stage of the proposed method (denoted as TS-MO method), an initial Kriging surrogate model is constructed in the augmented space and updated by sequentially adding enrichment points within the whole design space to obtain a coarse Kriging surrogate. In the local stage, within the multi-objective optimization iterations, the surrogate model is further refined using enrichment points selected in the vicinity of the current set of design points near the limit state function based on a distance-refined U learning function. Two convergence criteria with dynamic thresholds are employed to ensure the local precision of the trained surrogate model. The efficacy of the TS-MO method is demonstrated by conducting comparison works with two previous methods, i.e., the deterministic design optimization and global Kriging-based multi objective optimization method (DDO-GK-MO) and the unified method.

AB  - For reliability analysis of complex structures with time-consuming implicit performance functions, the computational cost required by direct sampling methods is usually unaffordable for engineering applications. However, the adaptive metamodel embedded in sampling methods can significantly improve reliability analysis efficiency. Therefore, a new metamodel-based directional importance sampling method (Meta-DIS-AK) is proposed for reliability analysis in this article. The main novelty of Meta-DIS-AK is constructing the quasi-optimal DIS density (DIS-D) by the Kriging model and giving a simple rejection sampling algorithm for accurately extracting DIS-D samples. By the constructed quasi-optimal DIS-D, the failure probability is transformed into a two-step estimation of augmented failure probability and a correction item. The updating of the first step is designed to ensure that the constructed DIS-D is well approaching to theoretical optimal DIS-D and obtain augmented failure probability estimation, and the second step updating can guarantee the accuracy of correction item estimation. Meta-DIS-AK not only overcomes the difficulties of constructing DIS-D and extracting importance direction vector samples in the existing DIS but also inherits the advantages of DIS in dealing with high-dimensional and small failure probability problems. Compared with the existing efficient sampling methods combined with AK, the results of the examples fully verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed Meta-DIS-AK.

AB  - Reliability analysis methods such as active learning Kriging surrogate model combined with simulation-based methods have been paid much attention in recent years. These techniques can reduce the computational cost to a certain extent. However, the computational burden may still be heavy for complex engineering problems. To address these issues, a Kriging-based important region sampling method is proposed for efficient reliability analysis. The new method is an improvement on the original active learning reliability method combining Kriging and Monte Carlo simulation (AK-MCS), and three strategies are developed to enhance the original method: 1) a new strategy, which is called the key point method, is utilized to define the initial design of experiment (DoE) instead of the Latin hypercube sampling; 2) the concept of dynamic important region/uncertain region and importance factor is proposed to avoid adding useless sample points to the DoE, which have little effect on the accuracy improvement of the Kriging model; 3) the redundant region is introduced to make the distance between the new and existed sample points be larger than a certain value and avoid the information redundancy caused by too close sample points. Five examples are utilized to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of this new method.

TI  - Application of a Random Forest Algorithm in Natural Landscape Animation Design
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Natural landscape simulation is one of the most popular research contents in computer graphics in the field of research simulation system. The natural landscape animation scene can immerse viewers in the scene, and it is widely used in visual simulation systems. Simulating natural scenery on a computer is a powerful method for studying the rules of the scenery's growth process as well as the mystery of life. The simulation of natural scenery is of particular importance and has far-reaching implications. The most important aspect of optimizing natural landscape design is creating a natural landscape animation that users enjoy. This article proposes a natural landscape animation design method with a self-learning function based on this concept. The random forest model (RF) is introduced in this method and applied to the entire animation design process. RF can generate a learning model with user evaluation as the classification result to guide the automatic design of natural landscape animation, resulting in user-satisfying animations. Simultaneously, the RF-based natural landscape animation design can continuously update the learning model based on user needs and is self-learning. The experimental part of this article verifies the effectiveness of the natural landscape animation design proposed in this article by comparing the selection rate of user satisfaction and dissatisfaction scenes, and further demonstrates that the method in this article can improve the natural landscape. The market application value of user satisfaction generated by animation is high.

AB  - Learning in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) has been widely used in many scientific disciplines. Because a RKHS can be very flexible, it is common to impose a regularization term in the optimization to prevent overfitting. Standard RKHS learning employs the squared norm penalty of the learning function. Despite its success, many challenges remain. In particular, one cannot directly use the squared norm penalty for variable selection or data extraction. Therefore, when there exists noise predictors, or the underlying function has a sparse representation in the dual space, the performance of standard RKHS learning can be suboptimal. In the literature, work has been proposed on how to perform variable selection in RKHS learning, and a data sparsity constraint was considered for data extraction. However, how to learn in a RKHS with both variable selection and data extraction simultaneously remains unclear. In this paper, we propose a unified RKHS learning method, namely, DOuble Sparsity Kernel (DOSK) learning, to overcome this challenge. An efficient algorithm is provided to solve the corresponding optimization problem. We prove that under certain conditions, our new method can asymptotically achieve variable selection consistency. Simulated and real data results demonstrate that DOSK is highly competitive among existing approaches for RKHS learning.

AB  - Decision-theoretic rough set model is the probabilistic generalization of the Pawlak rough set model. In this paper, we have analyzed decision-theoretic rough set model (DTRSM) in the context of attribute reduction. DTRSM is based on Bayesian decision theory for classifying an object into a particular category. The risk associated with classifying an object is defined in terms of loss functions and conditional probabilities. We have used least mean squares learning algorithm to determine the Bayesian loss functions by taking expected overall risk as the learning function. With the loss functions ready, DTRSM can be applied to classification problems. We have proposed attribute reduction in DTRSM by optimizing the expected overall risk using particle swarm optimization algorithm. The proposed algorithm was tested on various data sets found in University of California, machine learning repository. The proposed algorithm has given good results for the cardinality of the reduct and classification accuracy during tests performed on the data sets. Experimental results obtained by the proposed algorithm have been found to give better reduced length of the reduct and classification accuracy in comparison to the results obtained by the consistency subset evaluation feature selection algorithm described in the literature.

AB  - Owing to its time-consuming computation of complex structural responses, structural reliability analysis is still one of the challenging tasks. In this work, based on the FORM, the structural reliability analysis problem is transformed into a sequential surrogate constrained optimization problem. Subsequently, a reliability analysis method is developed that an adaptive radial basis function (RBF) metamodeling is adopted to approximate the performance function and the genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to solve the constrained optimization problem. The RBF is constructed on the initial design of experiments (DoE) generated by Latin hypercube sampling (LHS). Based on the metamodel, the GA is adopted to find the "potential" most probable point (MPP) by solving the constrained optimization problem, in which the distances between the found "potential" MPP to the existing DoE are dynamically controlled by a distance constraint. Then, the "potential" MPP is added to the DoE to refine the RBF. Finally, the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is employed to estimate the failure probability in terms of the metamodel. The above procedures are repeated until the failure probability converges. Five benchmark problems including small probability and high-dimensional situations are analyzed. The results illustrate the efficiency, accuracy, and robustness of the RBF-GA method.

AB  - Hybrid reliability analysis (HRA) has been extensively explored and mainly performed based on two categories of models. Mathematical properties on these models are given and proven in a rigorous manner, providing insights into HRA problems. Potential obstacles of the most appealing Kriging-based method available in literature for HRA include: metamodeling in an augmented-dimensional space spanned by both random and interval pa-rameters resulting in substantial inversion of a large correlation matrix, an absence of distance metric in learning functions causing sample clustering, repeated interval analysis mainly completed by either the sampling-based or optimization-based algorithm leading to excessive computational cost and memory requirements especially for high-dimensional interval inputs. In this sense, a dimension-wise analysis driven active learning paired-Kriging method is proposed, where a paired-Kriging metamodel is constructed solely in the random input space and, at each training point, the interval analysis is conducted by a dimension-wise analysis method. A new learning function and termination criterion are conceived for refining the paired-Kriging model. It is concluded that the proposed method outperforms the common-in-use ones for HRA with high-dimensional interval inputs while its accuracy and efficiency are comparable in the case of low-dimensional interval inputs after validating its nu-merical performance by typical issues.

AB  - Design of experiment and active learning strategy are vital for the surrogate-based reliability analysis. However, the existing sampling and modeling methods usually ignore some useful information that can guide the choice of training samples, or heavily rely on the characteristics of surrogates. These lead to the inefficiency of sampling strategies or limit the application respectively. Therefore, this work proposes a failure-pursuing sampling framework, which is able to adopt various surrogate models or active learning strategies. In each iteration, it organically and sequentially takes into account the joint probability density function of random variables, the individual information at candidate points and the improvement of the accuracy of predicted failure probability. To measure the probability of the improvement, a global predicted failure probability error is proposed based on the real-time reliability analysis result. Furthermore, Voronoi diagram is applied to partition the sampling region into some local cells for keeping the uniformity of the training samples. Besides, a model-free response-distance function is developed and combined with the framework to avoid relying on the characteristics of surrogates, such as the statistical information provided by Kriging. Finally, four examples are investigated to demonstrate the applicability, stability and generality of the proposed method.

AB  - Machine learning methods have been widely applied to structural reliability analysis, due to the excellent performance in modeling precision and efficiency. In this paper, an adaptive directed support vector machine model (ADSVM) is proposed by integrating the adaptive sampling technology (AST) and the developed directed support vector machine (DSVM), to improve the efficiency and accuracy of turbine blade reliability analysis. In the developed method, the AST is adopted to extract high quality samples, in respect of distributed probability density and the distances between sample values and response values. The DSVM was developed by introducing the penalty coefficients for all the slack variables, to improve the modeling accuracy of SVM approach. One numerical example and the reliability analysis of aeroengine high-pressure turbine blade were performed to validate the developed methods. As illustrated in this numerical investigation, the modeling precision of DSVM is improved by alleviating the lag effect of support vector regression. From the comparison of methods, it is demonstrated that the ADSVM has higher accuracy, efficiency and stability in reliability simulations, which are improved by -20 % and -46.2 %, respectively. The main efforts of this study are to propose a promising approach, ADSVM, for the reliability analysis of complex structures besides turbine blades, which hold the academical significance in enriching and developing mechanical reliability theory.

AB  - With the development of computer applications in ship design, optimization, as a powerful approach, has been widely used in the design and analysis process. However, the running time, which often varies from several weeks to months in the current computing environment, has been a bottleneck problem for optimization applications, particularly in the structural design of ships. To speed up the optimization process and adjust the complex design environment, ship designers usually rely on their personal experience to assist the design work. However, traditional experience, which largely depends on the designer's personal skills, often makes the design quality very sensitive to the experience and decreases the robustness of the final design. This paper proposes a new machine-learning-based ship design optimization approach, which uses machine learning as an effective tool to give direction to optimization and improves the adaptability of optimization to the dynamic design environment. The natural human learning process is introduced into the optimization procedure to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Q-learning, as an approach of reinforcement learning, is utilized to realize the learning function in the optimization process. The multi-objective particle swarm optimization method, multi-agent system, and CAE software are used to build an integrated optimization system. A bulk carrier structural design optimization was performed as a case study to evaluate the suitability of this method for real-world application. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to realize the self-learning of the platform, an improved RBF neural network model is adopted, and a similarity matching algorithm is added, which improves the comfort of platform users and reduces redundant knowledge links. Based on constructivism, platform moral education constructs an intelligent computing learning platform with autonomous learning function through the construction mode. Based on the relatively perfect database, the moral learning platform extracts relevant resources for the platform teaching mode and basic services respectively, so as to optimize the platform design. Rely on computer technology to establish educational resource database, extract or collect teaching resources from all aspects, and form a database group with complete information. After the platform content design is completed, different interfaces are used to link to different end users. The establishment of multi-interface can make the system online at different terminals, fully consider the user's moral learning environment, and let users learn online anytime and anywhere. Compared with the traditional algorithm, the improved algorithm adds the similar matching function on the basis of RBF algorithm. It reduces the phenomenon of repeated push in students' autonomous learning system. The similarity matching algorithm is added to improve the comfort of platform users and reduce the redundant knowledge chain. The construction of moral learning teaching mode not only increases the interaction of the platform, but also improves the efficiency of user education and learning, and enhances the user's awareness of intelligent computing.

AB  - The strength reduction method (SRM) has many advantages compared with the limit equilibrium method (LEM) in computing the safety factor of slopes, but the high computational cost, to some extent, limits the application of SRM in system reliability analyses of slopes. To effectively reduce the number of numerical analyses required for reliability analyses to alleviate the computation work when employing SRM, an efficient analysis method based on active-learning radial basis function (ARBF) surrogate model is introduced. This model uses the active-learning function to select trained samples near the limit state surface to update the surrogate model, which accelerates the convergence speed of the training process. With the linear kernel-based radial basis function, the optimization procedure of model parameters is simplified, by which a concise and stable surrogate model can be established. Moreover, an initial sampling strategy considering the characteristics of soil slopes is proposed to fully take advantage of active-learning process. Once a stable surrogate model is established, Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is used to calculate the probability of system failure. As a comparison, two conventional reliability methods: active-learning Kriging (AK) model and the quadratic response surface method (QRMS), together with two typical soil slope cases, are tested to illustrate the computational efficiency and model stability of the introduced ARBF.

Considering the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, PCK is optimal. The Constrained Min-Max (CMM) learning function only depends on sample information, so it is suitable for most surrogate models. In the four calculation examples, the performance of the combination of CMM and PCK is relatively good. Thus, it is recommended for reliability evaluation problems of automobile components.Originality/valueAlthough a lot of research has been conducted on adaptive surrogate-model-based reliability evaluation method, there are still relatively few studies on the comprehensive application of this method to the reliability evaluation of automobile component. In this study, different adaptive learning strategies and surrogate models are combined to study their performance in reliability assessment of automobile components. Specially, a superior surrogate-model-based reliability evaluation method combination is illustrated in this study, which is instructive for adaptive surrogate-model-based reliability analysis in the reliability evaluation problem of automobile components.

AB  - For efficiently estimating the time-dependent failure probability, two new methods named as the active learning Kriging (AK) coupled with importance sampling (AK-co-IS) and AK coupled with subset simulation (AK-co-SS) are proposed. The proposed methods are based on the fact that the AK coupled with Monte Carlo simulation (AKMCS) method has been proved to be a very efficient method. However, for problem with small time-dependent failure probability or long service time, the size of candidate sample pool generated by MCS would be so large that the efficiency of AK-MCS is reduced. Therefore, the AK-co-IS and AK-co-SS are proposed to highly enhance the computational efficiency by greatly reducing the candidate sample pool size. And these two methods reduce the candidate sample pool size respectively by searching the optimal time-dependent design point to increase the ratio of failure samples and converting a rare event simulation problem into sequence of more frequent event ones. Through iteratively constructing the AK model to be convergent by the U-learning function in the IS and SS sample pools, respectively, the computational cost of estimating the time-dependent failure probability would reduce drastically compared with AK-MCS. Several examples are used to illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed methods.

AB  - This paper develops an efficient algorithm that combines polynomial-chaos kriging (PCK) and adaptive radialbased importance sampling (ARBIS) for reliability analysis. The key idea of ARBIS is to adaptively determine a sphere with the center at the origin and radius equal to the smallest distance of the failure domain to the origin, also known as the optimal fl-sphere, and only those samples outside the optimal fl-sphere have a possibility of failure and thus need to evaluate the limit-state function to judge their states (safe or failure). In the proposed algorithm, both the PCK model and fl-sphere are updated adaptively. In each iteration of determining the optimal fl-sphere, the PCK model is updated sequentially based on an active learning function, which is used to select the most informative sample from the samples between the last and current fl-spheres. Once the stopping criterion is met, the learning process of PCK in this iteration terminates, and the obtained PCK model is then used to determine the next fl-sphere. The updating iteration of the fl-sphere proceeds until the optimal sphere is found. Five representative examples are revisited, in which the results demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed PCK-ARBIS algorithm.

AB  - Hybrid reliability analysis with mixed random and interval uncertainties is a significant challenge in the reliability assessment of engineering structures. The situation will be more intractable when involving incomplete interval data. To obtain reliable estimates of the failure probability limits, an effective parameter estimation method, integrating the quantile variant of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm and Kullback-Leibler divergence, is proposed to transform uncertain variables with incomplete data into random variables with distribution uncertainty. Then, an adaptive Kriging-assisted hybrid reliability analysis method is developed to ensure computational accuracy and efficiency. In this method, a candidate pool incorporating the distribution uncertainty is constructed and its size is adaptively reduced by removing the samples that violate the projection uniformity on input dimensions with exact distributions. Meanwhile, an improved U learning function and an error-based convergence criterion are defined to drive and stop the adaptive process. Then the failure probability limits are estimated by combining the refined Kriging model and Monte Carlo simulation. Four application examples are employed to verify the superiority of the proposed method. Comparison results show that the proposed method can significantly improve computational efficiency while ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the estimated failure probability interval under incomplete interval observations.

AB  - Kriging-based adaptive structural reliability analysis methods can replace the structural performance function and perform reliability analysis accurately and efficiently by using appropriate learning functions. In this context, a novel adaptive structural reliability analysis strategy, namely, confidence interval squeezing (CIS) method, is presented in this paper. After obtaining the confidence interval of the failure probability on the basis of the given significance level ??, CIS considers squeezing the confidence interval at the highest speed possible to improve the accuracy of estimating the failure probability. CIS strives to improve the estimation accuracy of failure probability rapidly rather than paying too much attention to the state of a single candidate sample, which is the primary difference between the CIS method and other learning functions. In addition, a new global convergence condition is proposed based on the confidence interval of failure probability. Considering the difficulty of direct application of CIS, three variants of the CIS method, namely, sCIS method for sequence additions, pCIS method for parallel additions based on a clustering algorithm, and improved pCIS (ipCIS) method, are proposed. Several examples are used to demonstrate that each CIS method can handle the complex limit state function and the engineering problem of implicit functions efficiently and accurately.

AB  - Metamodel-based seismic fragility analysis methods can overcome the challenge of high computational costs of problems considering the uncertainties of earthquakes and structural parameters; however, the accuracy of metamodels is difficult to control. To enhance the efficiency of analyses without compromising accuracy, a metamodeling method using Gaussian process regression (GPR) and active learning (AL) for seismic fragility analysis is proposed. In this method, a GPR metamodel is built to estimate the stochastic seismic response of a structure, in which the record-to-record variability is considered as in the dual-metamodel-based fragility analysis approach. The metamodel can also predict the estimation error. Taking advantage of this ability, we present an AL strategy for adaptive sampling, so that the metamodel can be improved adaptively according to the problem. Using this metamodel and Monte Carlo simulation, seismic fragility curves can be obtained with a small number of calls for time history analysis. To verify its effectiveness, the proposed method was applied to three examples of nonlinear structures and compared with existing methods. The results show that this method has high computational efficiency and can ensure the accuracy of fragility curves without making the metamodel globally accurate.

AB  - As the numerical model of engineering structure becomes more and more complicated and time consuming, efficient structural reliability analysis is badly in need. To reduce the number of calls to the performance function and iterative times during structural reliability analysis, an innovative strategy of the design of experiments (DoE) called Isomap-Clustering strategy is proposed. According to the statistical information provided by Kriging, points with the worst uncertainty for reliability analysis are on the estimated limit state. Therefore, by combining Isomap and k-means clustering algorithm, Isomap-Clustering strategy refreshes the DoE of the Kriging model with a few representative points in the vicinity of the estimated limit state each iteration and iteratively "pushes" the estimated limit state to the real one until a stopping condition is satisfied. By employing the proposed DoE strategy and sparse polynomial-Kriging model, a structural reliability analysis method is constructed, whose stopping criterion is defined by derivation. Three examples are studied. Results show that the proposed method can lower the number of calls to the performance function and remarkably reduces the iterations of structural reliability analysis.

AB  - The advent of diverse frequency bands in 5G networks has promoted measurement studies focused on 5G signal propagation, aiming to understand its pathloss, coverage, and channel quality characteristics. Nonetheless, conducting a thorough 5G measurement campaign is markedly laborious given the large number of samples that must be collected. To alleviate this burden, the present contribution leverages principled active learning (AL) methods to prudently select only a few, yet most informative locations to collect samples. The core idea is to rely on a Gaussian Process (GP) model to efficiently extrapolate measurements throughout the coverage area. Specifically, an ensemble (E) of GP models is adopted that not only provides a rich learning function space, but also quantifies uncertainty, and can offer accurate predictions. Building on this EGP model, a suite of acquisition functions (AFs) are advocated to query new locations on-the-fly. To account for realistic scenaria, the proposed AFs are augmented with a novel distance-based AL rule that selects informative samples, while penalizing queries at long distances. Numerical tests on 5G data generated by the Sionna simulator and on real urban and suburban datasets, showcase the merits of the novel EGP-AL approaches.

AB  - System reliability analysis involving multiple failure modes is challenging when performance functions are associated with time-consuming codes. This paper aims to enhance the efficiency of system reliability analysis by reducing the number of evaluations of time-consuming models. To achieve that, an adaptive Kriging-based method is proposed. In order to develop the method, a quantificational error measure of Kriging models (i.e. surrogate models of performance functions associated with each failure mode) is first derived. The stepwise accuracy-improvement strategy (SAIS) is then modified to solve system reliability problems, and the modified SAIS is called SAIS-SYS. The method for system reliability analysis is finally developed based on the derived error measure and SAIS-SYS. In the proposed method, Kriging models, i.e. the surrogate models of original performance functions, are adaptively refreshed according to SAIS-SYS until the associated error measure is smaller than a prescribed threshold. After Kriging models meet with accuracy requirement, the system failure probability can be obtained through a random simulation method and no additional evaluations of original performance functions is needed. The accuracy, efficiency and robustness of the proposed method are validated by four examples.

AB  - A modified model combining Kriging and Monte Carlo method (MC) is proposed for probabilistic estimation of tunnel face stability in this paper. In the model, a novel uniform design is adopted to train the Kriging, instead of the existing active learning function. It has advantage of avoiding addition of new training points iteratively, and greatly saves the computational time in model training The kinematic approach of limit analysis is employed to define the deterministic computational model of face failure, in which the Hoek-Brown failure criterion is introduced to account for the nonlinear behaviors of rock mass. The trained Kriging is used as a surrogate model to perform MC with dramatic reduction of calls to actual limit state function. The parameters in Hoek-Brown failure criterion are considered as random variables in the analysis. The failure probability is estimated by direct MC to test the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed probabilistic model. The influences of uncertainty level, correlation relationship and distribution type of random variables are further discussed using the proposed approach. In summary, the probabilistic model is an accurate and economical alternative to perform probabilistic stability analysis of tunnel face excavated in spatially random Hoek- Brown media.

AB  - A new defrosting method - the sensible heat defrosting method, aiming at shelving the various disadvantages of the conventional reverse cycle defrosting was proposed in this paper. The mechanism and process of this method was analysed. To guarantee the reliability, the self-organizing control algorithm with self-learning function was introduced based on the cardinal fuzzy control algorithm. Moreover, the control strategy was enacted; the corresponding self-organizing fuzzy control system was developed; the Micro Controller Unit (MCU) based control unit was accomplished; and the experimental study was conducted to investigate the sample machine of air-source heat pump system. The results of the experiments showed that the self-organizing control algorithm has good control characteristic and effect. On one hand, the adverse shock from the conventional reverse cycle defrosting to the refrigeration system could be avoided through this proposed method; on the other hand, the "oil rush" could also be eliminated. Besides, the thermal comfort could be greatly improved since the temperature fluctuation range of the supplied water is narrowed by applying this new method in practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The well-known BUS algorithm (i.e., Bayesian Updating with Structural reliability) transforms Bayesian updating problems into structural reliability to address challenges of updating with equality information and improve computational efficiency. However, as the number of observations increases, the resulting failure probability or acceptance ratio becomes exceedingly small, requiring a formidable number of evaluations of the likelihood function. To overcome this limitation especially for complex computational models, this paper presents a new approach where the probability estimation problem of the very rare event associated with updating is decomposed into a set of sub-reliability problems with uncertain failure thresholds. Two concepts of Conditional Acceptance Rate Curve (CARC) and Dynamic Learning Function (DLF) are proposed to enable precise identification of the intermediate failure thresholds and to train Kriging surrogate models for the established limit state functions. Two benchmark numerical examples and a practical corrosion problem in marine environments are investigated to analyze the efficiency of the proposed method relative to BUS and other state-of-the-art methods. Results indicate that the proposed method can reduce computational costs by about an order of magnitude while maintaining high accuracy; therefore, enabling Bayesian updating of complex computational models.

KW  - LEARNING-FUNCTION
AB  - Adaptive surrogate-based reliability analysis methods have garnered significant attention due to their potential to enhance computational efficiency in accurately estimating failure probability. However, the candidate sample pool remains constant for most surrogate-based reliability methods, and traversing the candidate sample pool one by one will reduce the efficiency of surrogate modeling. More importantly, maintaining a static sample pool may lead to the inclusion of samples that contribute minimally to the construction of the surrogate modeling, thereby impacting the accuracy and efficiency of the reliability analysis. Accordingly, this paper leverages the robust performance of Bayesian support vector regression to propose a dynamic pruning strategy for the candidate sample pool to estimate failure probability efficiently. A dynamic pruning strategy is presented to streamline the process further, iteratively reducing the candidate sample pool. An adaptive learning algorithm is then introduced, integrating the U function and the sparsity of training samples. This is complemented by a formulated convergence condition, contributing to an ideal surrogate model. The proposed approaches showcase superior efficiency and accuracy through illustrations using well-known benchmark problems and complex reliability analysis problems involving small failure probability and high-dimensional limit state function.

AB  - Time-dependent reliability analysis (TRA) has attracted widespread attention due to its viability in evaluating the reliability of structures during the entire service life. However, TRA for complicated structures often leads to extremely high computational cost. To alleviate computational burden, this study develops a most probable point (MPP)-oriented Kriging model combined with the importance sampling (MPP-KIS) method for TRA. The strategy is that a comprehensive Kriging modeling method based on MPP is developed to construct the surrogate models for instantaneous performance functions discretized from the time-dependent reliability problem. A new learning function and a precise stopping criterion that take into account of the accuracy of the Kriging around MPP are contrived for updating the surrogate models. An adaptive screening strategy is introduced to identify the safe time trajectories to spare calculating the responses. The importance sampling method is integrated with the adaptive screening strategy for efficient computation of the time-dependent probability of failure. Two numerical examples and two engineering cases are exemplified to demonstrate the effectiveness and proficiency of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed MPP-KIS method achieves reliable results with substantially improved computational efficiency.

KW  - SYSTEM
AB  - As an emerging technology of computer-aided education, cognitive modeling aims at discovering the knowledge proficiency or learning ability of students, which can enable a wide range of intelligent educational applications. While considerable efforts have been made in this direction, a long-standing research challenge is how to naturally integrate the forgetting mechanism into the learning process of knowledge concepts. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Time based Neural Cognitive Modeling (CT-NCM) approach to integrate the dynamism and continuity of knowledge forgetting into students' learning process modeling in a realistic manner. To be specific, we first adapt the neural Hawkes process with a specially-designed learning event encoding method to model the relationship between knowledge learning and forgetting with continuous time. Then, we propose a learning function with extendable settings to jointly model the change of different knowledge states and their interactions with the exercises at each moment. In this way, CT-NCM can simultaneously predict the future knowledge state and exercise performance of students. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on five real-world datasets with various benchmark methods. The experimental results clearly validate the effectiveness of CT-NCM and show its interpretability in terms of knowledge learning visualization.

AB  - Surrogate models have been widely used in structural reliability analysis to improve the computational efficiency and the accuracy of failure probability. Recently, several multi-kernel relevance vector regression (MKRVR) models have been studied to evaluate the failure probability. However, existing multiple kernel functions for relevance vector regression models are fixed choices, which increases the number of calls to the limit state function (LSF) and leads to inaccurate results. To address the problem, this paper presents a new adaptive MKRVR model combined with Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). Firstly, a stepwise kernel selection strategy is developed to adaptively select better-performing kernel functions and eliminate redundant kernel functions for constructing the MKRVR model. Secondly, a new active learning function is proposed by considering the probability of mis-prediction and spatial locations of the existing sampling point to identify the new training sample points. Thirdly, a hybrid efficient stopping criterion is adopted to terminate the learning process automatically. Three benchmark examples and one practical engineering example are introduced to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method can provide accurate failure probability by less number of calls to the LSF than existing fixed kernel-based methods.

AB  - In this paper, the research work of the torque model in plate rolling process, with biting impact considered, is carried out based on mechanical dynamics and the rolling process technology. The five-degree-of-freedom mechanical dynamic model was established for the main drive system of the actual heavy plate mill, considering the clearance between parts. The biting peak torques under different rolling process conditions were calculated. The influence of the biting time and the steady-state torque were analyzed: the biting peak torque decreases with the biting time increasing, and increases with the steady-state torque increasing. The biting time calculation model was established based on the rolling process parameters. The steady-state torque model was improved by rebuilding level arm ratio model. The influence of deformation area arithmetic average aspect ratio and reduction rate was considered. The calculation model of biting peak torque is built with biting time and steady-state torque influence. The model accuracy is verified by comparing the calculated data with actual data. The average deviation of steady-state torque and peak biting impact torque is within +/- 8%, and +/- 10%. The accuracy of these models can be improved by offline intelligent method and online learning function, subsequently.

AB  - Reliability assessment with adaptive Kriging has gained notoriety due to the Kriging capability of accurately replacing the performance function while performing as a self-improving function for learning procedures.
   Recent works on adaptive Kriging pursued to improve the efficiency of the active learning through the application of distinct learning functions, sampling methods, or frameworks to assess the learning space. Within this context, the present work exploits three innovative applications of density scanning to improve the efficiency of the adaptive Kriging. Density scanning has significant synergies with adaptive Kriging implementation. For most learning criteria, candidate points occur in dense clusters. This is due to the fact that the most efficient learning strategies pursue to improve predictions near the failure region, or when the prediction uncertainty is large.
   Identifying dense clusters of points, and fomenting exploitation of these, parallelizing computations, and limiting the generation of dense clusters in the design of experiments are examples of learning frameworks that can be achieved with density scanning. Three reference examples are researched in the present work, a complex function, a series system, and a relatively high dimension engineering problem. For all the cases, the application of density scanning is identified to improve the active learning efficiency.

AB  - As one of the most important nursing interventions of ventilated patients' respiratory tract, secretion clearance is usually used to keep the respiratory tract clear, improve alveolar ventilation and patients' breathing function. However, the existing secretion clearance technologies have serious defects in efficiency, safety and automation. Considering these disadvantages above, this paper proposes an intelligent secretion system, which combines doctors' theoretical knowledge, clinical experience and engineering technology. In this system, three key technologies will be broken through to form a set of simple, safe, efficient and automatic secretion clearance technology, which are 1. On-line identification technology of the time when to clear secretion; 2. Intelligent control technology of the secretion clearance system based on simulation of the human natural cough; 3. Breathing simulation technology with self-learning function. This system will provide an intelligent method to keep patients' respiratory tract clear, prevent respiratory system infection, avoid the damage to respiratory tracts and ensure mechanical ventilation treatment goals. The technology proposed in this paper is poised to replace catheter suction technology as the most common secretion clearance technology in clinic. Ultimately, this technology will improve the secretion clearance technology level of China, save lives of ventilated patients', reduce patients' pain and the work intensity of medical staffs.

AB  - Structural safety of functionally graded material considering multi-source uncertainties significantly impacts its application in thermal protection systems. To accurately quantify the uncertain factors and evaluate the structural safety, this paper presents a novel reliability analysis method for functionally graded plates based on the ellipsoid-interval formed evidence theory. Firstly, the thermal behavior of a corrugated sandwich panel with webs made of functionally graded material is analyzed by the finite element method. Subsequently, considering the inconsistent correlation of uncertain variables, this paper develops an ellipsoid-interval formed evidence theory model which consists of ellipsoid-formed frame of discernment for correlated variables and intervalformed discernment for independent variables. On this basis, a novel evidence theory-based reliability analysis framework is constructed for structural safety assessment considering multi-source uncertainties. Meanwhile, to improve the computational efficiency of the limit state function, a new active learning Kriging model, which utilizes a variance reduction function as the sampling strategy, is developed as the surrogate model. Finally, a mathematical example and an engineering case of a thermal protection system are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Aiming at the problem of structural reliability analysis with complex performance function in practical engineering, an adaptive adding point strategy for structural reliability analysis is proposed by combining Kriging surrogate model and learning function. In the process of structural reliability analysis, in order to reduce the computational cost, the surrogate model is usually used to fit the implicit performance function. Existing learning functions rarely take into account the problem of sample point aggregation due to too many sample points selected from the failure domain (or safety domain) during the fitting process. In order to overcome this defect, a new method can ensure that the added sample points are evenly distributed on both sides of the limit state function, preventing the aggregation of sample points and causing information redundancy, thereby improving the fitting accuracy of the model, accelerating the convergence speed of the sample points and saving the sample space. Through the analysis of four-branch series system, nonlinear oscillator and truss structure, the results show that the algorithm needs less samples than other methods, and the reliability calculation accuracy is higher, which verifies the correctness and efficiency of the proposed method.

AB  - Cassava is a plant that is widely found in Indonesia with various benefits. One of the benefits of cassava is as a substitute for rice. According to data from the Indonesian Central Statistics Agency in 2015, cassava production in Indonesia was 21,801,415 tons a year. Lampung Province is the largest producer of cassava in Indonesia. In 2016, its production decreased due to disease attacking the cassava plant. One of the deep learning methods currently being developed is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This network is built with the assumption that the input used is an image. This technique can make the image learning function more efficient to implement. Therefore, this study will take advantage of the advantages of CNN, namely being able to classify an object intended for image data so that the CNN model will be used as an introduction to the four types of healthy cassava leaf and cassava leaf diseases that can be found in Indonesia. By using the Tensorflow library, the results of model trials and evaluations of cassava leaf images show an accuracy of 0.8538 for training and 0.7496 for data validation. So it can be concluded that the implementation of Deep Learning with the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method can detect cassava leaf disease images.

AB  - With the rapid development of Cloud-based services, the necessity of a Cloud service discovery engine becomes a fundamental requirement. A semantic focused crawler is one of the most key components of Cloud service discovery engines. However, the huge size and varied functionalities of Cloud services on the Web have a great effect on crawlers to provide effective Cloud services. It is a challenge for semantic crawlers to search only for URLs that offer Cloud services from this explosion of information. To solve these issues, this paper proposes a self-adaptive semantic focused crawler based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for efficient Cloud service discovery. In this paper, we present a Cloud Service Ontology (CSOnt) that defines Cloud service categories. CSOnt contains a set of concepts, allowing the crawler to automatically collect and categorize Cloud services. Moreover, our proposed crawler adopts URLs priority techniques to maintain the order of URLs to be parsed for efficient retrieval of the relevant Cloud services. Additionally, we create a self-adaptive semantic focused crawler, which has an ontology-learning function to automatically improve the proposed Cloud Service Ontology and maintain the crawler's performance.

AB  - In recent years, reliability analysis based on adaptive Kriging (AK) has been extensively studied. However, constructing the Kriging model of high-dimensional systems during adaptive learning faces huge computational challenges. This paper combines partial least squares (PLS) with AK to develop an efficient method for reliability analysis of high-dimensional systems, which is named as PLS-AK. The proposed method takes PLS algorithm as the dimensionality reduction (DR) technique of high-dimensional input variables. Then, in the reduced space of input principal components (PCs), a low-dimensional Kriging model is constructed with U learning function for reliability analysis. Since PLS usually requires adequate samples to determine the latent relationship between input and output variables, using too many initial samples before adaptive learning will weaken the advantages of AK. To avoid this problem, this paper also proposes a synchronous updating method for both the projection direction and AK model. In this way, only a few initial samples are required to determine the initial input projection, and the input projection will be updated and converge gradually as the number of training samples increases. At last, three examples can prove the effectiveness of the proposed PLS-AK method.

AB  - Probability distributions of structural responses have been widely used in many engineering applications and their accuracy could significantly affect the performance and credibility of these applications. To obtain accurate distributions, existing methods often need massive calculations of the original response function, especially for highly nonlinear problems. To alleviate the computational burden, this paper proposes a multi-region active learning Kriging method to construct response distributions of highly nonlinear problems. First, a low-precision CDF curve is built based on the one-iteration MPP search and MPP prediction. Multiple regions and response values are then identified to obtain the limit state surfaces for Kriging modeling. To determine the best training points, a multi-region learning strategy including rough and precise selections is developed based on the U learning function and a hybrid index of the reward-based probability and nonlinearity. A two-level stopping criterion is further provided to achieve fast convergence and high accuracy. Finally, the response distributions are constructed using the obtained Kriging model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by four examples.

AB  - High-precision filtering estimation is one of the key techniques for strapdown inertial navigation system/global navigation satellite system (SINS/GNSS) integrated navigation system, and its estimation plays an important role in the performance evaluation of the navigation system. Traditional filter estimation methods usually assume that the measurement noise conforms to the Gaussian distribution, without considering the influence of the pollution introduced by the GNSS signal, which is susceptible to external interference. To address this problem, a high-precision filter estimation method using Gaussian process regression (GPR) is proposed to enhance the prediction and estimation capability of the unscented quaternion estimator (USQUE) to improve the navigation accuracy. Based on the advantage of the GPR machine learning function, the estimation performance of the sliding window for model training is measured. This method estimates the output of the observation information source through the measurement window and realizes the robust measurement update of the filter. The combination of GPR and the USQUE algorithm establishes a robust mechanism framework, which enhances the robustness and stability of traditional methods. The results of the trajectory simulation experiment and SINS/GNSS car-mounted tests indicate that the strategy has strong robustness and high estimation accuracy, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Visual analysis of human behavior has generated considerable interest in the field of computer vision because of its wide spectrum of potential applications. Human behavior can be segmented into atomic actions, each of which indicates a basic and complete movement. Learning and recognizing atomic human actions are essential to human behavior analysis. In this paper, we propose a framework for handling this task using variable-length Markov models (VLMMs). The framework is comprised of the following two modules: a posture labeling module and a VLMM atomic action learning and recognition module. First, a posture template selection algorithm, based on a modified shape context matching technique, is developed. The selected posture templates form a codebook that is used to convert input posture sequences into discrete symbol sequences for subsequent processing. Then, the VLMM technique is applied to learn the training symbol sequences of atomic actions. Finally, the constructed VLMMs are transformed into hidden Markov models (HMMs) for recognizing input atomic actions. This approach combines the advantages of the excellent learning function of a VLMM and the fault-tolerant recognition ability of an HMM. Experiments on realistic data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system.

AB  - Safety lifetime analysis performs a crucial role in ensuring structural safety in service and developing effective maintenance strategies, which also places higher demands on calculation. However, existing safety lifetime analysis methods generally suffer from inefficiency, which is more prominent for complex engineering structures. In this paper, a novel sequential single-loop Kriging (SSK) surrogate modeling approach is proposed to calculate the safety lifetime in an efficient and accurate manner. To reduce the computational cost, a single-loop safety lifetime analysis framework is proposed. In this framework, there is no need to accurately calculate the timedependent failure probability (TDFP) in any sub-time interval. By searching the safety lifetime in the process of time-dependent reliability analysis (TRA) and dynamically adjusting the interest time interval, the safety lifetime can be quickly determined by constructing only one Kriging model. To maximize the utilization of sample information, SSK employs a modified learning function that allows most of the training points to be added before the safety lifetime. For accuracy, a convergence criterion that includes two Kriging models is proposed. Mathematical engineering examples are used to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of SSK. The proposed method offers a promising approach for efficient safety lifetime analysis of engineering problems.

AB  - Bayesian active learning methods have emerged for structural reliability analysis, showcasing more attractive features compared to existing active learning methods. The parallel adaptive Bayesian quadrature (PABQ) method, as a representative of them, allows to efficiently assessing small failure probabilities but faces the problem of empirically specifying several important parameters. The unreasonable parameter settings could lead to the inaccurate estimates of failure probability or the non -convergence of active learning. This study proposes a refined PABQ (R-PABQ) method by presenting three novel refinements to overcome the drawbacks of PABQ. Firstly, a sequential population enrichment strategy is presented and embedded into the importance ball sampling technique to solve the computer memory problem when involving large sample population. Secondly, an adaptive determination strategy for radius is developed to automatically adjust the sampling region during the active learning procedure. Lastly, an adaptive multi -point selection method is proposed to identify a batch of points to enable parallel computing. The effectiveness of the proposed R-PABQ method is demonstrated by four numerical examples. Results show that the proposed method can estimate small failure probabilities (e.g., 10-7 similar to 10-9) with superior accuracy and efficiency over several existing active learning reliability methods.

AB  - Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms enables access to Machine Learning (ML) processing with scalable infrastructure, from anywhere, and at any time, but requires sending large amounts of data to the cloud. ML on the edge is emerging as an option to reduce latency and bandwidth usage, maintaining data privacy. However, the existing edge approaches are not aware of the current network state for orchestrating the tasks. Network-aware orchestration services are supported by the Network Function Virtualization (NFV) architecture, making it a promising approach to manage and place ML tasks. In this paper, we propose Machine Learning Function Virtualization (MLFV), a fully network-aware framework that explores the NFV environment to virtualize ML tasks as virtual network functions. We describe a novel model for placing chains of ML tasks, considering constraints on CPU, memory, the existence of ML libraries, and the network overload, aiming to reduce the overall execution time of a chain. The results showed that MLFV outperformed existing cloud and edge approaches, particularly when network connections present instabilities. MLFV was able to identify the irregularities, allocating the ML tasks on hosts with normal connections, and thus, reducing the time for classifying single and multiple concurrent requests.

AB  - Based on the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy controller and adaptive control theory, this study presents the design of an adaptive TSK fuzzy controller (ATSKFC). With an online learning function, this controller is an improvement on the traditional PI controller, whose parameters are fixed. An improved model for a compensating controller is also proposed to address the problems caused by the fixed parameters of traditional compensating controllers, and thereby enhance the transient responses of motors. Because the stator resistance of induction motors varies according to changes in temperature, this study designed a MRAS stator resistance estimator based on the model reference adaptive system (MRAS) and ATSKFC to enable real-time adjustments of the stator resistance. By adopting direct torque control (DTC) technology, this study was able to control the induction motor speed and thereby obtain various benefits, such as fast transient responses, a simple architecture, and simple computing processes. To solve torque ripple and noise problems caused by conventional hysteresis torque and flux control, this study employed the space voltage vector modulation technique for DTC. Additionally, we used a speed estimator to realize speed sensor-free control, with the benefits of lowering costs and preventing damage to the motor structure.

AB  - Over the last decade, the ever increasing world-wide demand for early detection of breast cancer at many screening sites and hospitals has resulted in the need of new research avenues. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an early detection of cancer greatly increases the chances of taking the right decision on a successful treatment plan. The Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems are applied widely in the detection and differential diagnosis of many different kinds of abnormalities. Therefore, improving the accuracy of a CAD system has become one of the major research areas. In this paper, a CAD scheme for detection of breast cancer has been developed using deep belief network unsupervised path followed by back propagation supervised path. The construction is back-propagation neural network with Liebenberg Marquardt learning function while weights are initialized from the deep belief network path (DBN-NN). Our technique was tested on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD). The classifier complex gives an accuracy of 99.68% indicating promising results over previously-published studies. The proposed system provides an effective classification model for breast cancer. In addition, we examined the architecture at several train-test partitions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Widespread uncertainty in engineering problems makes it necessary to carry out structural reliability analysis. The crude Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method can obtain accurate results, but it requires a large number of model evaluations. The Kriging-based method is a feasible way to reduce the computational cost. This study proposes a novel adaptive analysis method. Firstly, the convergence condition based on estimation accuracy is introduced. This condition focuses on the precision of the failure probability rather than the state of the points in the candidate sample pool. Then three extended U learning strategies are proposed. Sequence strategy (#1) focuses on evenly selecting samples by exploiting information on both sides of the limit state function. Strategy (#2) adopts the parallel adaptive learning technique to simultaneously select samples in both the safe and failure domains. Strategy (#3) pays attention to low-precision domains and can adaptively choose between sequential and parallel analysis modes. The choice of the three strategies can be based on the parallel computing resources available to researchers. Finally, three numerical cases and one engineering case are presented. This study provides an efficient tool for reliability evaluation of practical engineering problems.

AB  - Active-learning reliability analysis is essentially a problem of sequential decision making under uncertainty from the Bayesian decision-theoretic perspective. Hence, leveraging on basic principle of the one-step look -ahead policy, a novel learning function named Targeted integrated mean squared error (TIMSE) is proposed to combine polynomial-chaos Kriging and probability density evolution method for structural reliability analysis. The TIMSE makes the following three critical contributions. First, its closed-form formula is tractable, getting rid of cumbersome issues about numerical quadrature or drawing realizations of Gaussian process. Second, the TIMSE accounts for global impacts of adding a new point on any other point. Third, the TIMSE takes into account the horizon of future experimental designs, by virtue of Kriging update formulae. Besides, a hybrid convergence criterion is developed that effectively avoids two categories of premature termination. Two benchmark analytical functions and three numerical examples are investigated, and comparisons are made against several existing reliability methods. Results indicate that the TIMSE outperforms its localized version and other existing learning functions. Moreover, the proposed reliability approach is more computationally advantageous when time-consuming, complex dynamic problems are involved.

AB  - Anomaly detection with weakly supervised video-level labels is typically formulated as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem, in which we aim to identify snippets containing abnormal events, with each video represented as a bag of video snippets. Although current methods show effective detection performance, their recognition of the positive instances, i.e., rare abnormal snippets in the abnormal videos, is largely biased by the dominant negative instances, especially when the abnormal events are subtle anomalies that exhibit only small differences compared with normal events. This issue is exacerbated in many methods that ignore important video temporal dependencies. To address this issue, we introduce a novel and theoretically sound method, named Robust Temporal Feature Magnitude learning (RTFM), which trains a feature magnitude learning function to effectively recognise the positive instances, substantially improving the robustness of the MIL approach to the negative instances from abnormal videos. RTFM also adapts dilated convolutions and self-attention mechanisms to capture long- and short-range temporal dependencies to learn the feature magnitude more faithfully. Extensive experiments show that the RTFM-enabled MIL model (i) outperforms several state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on four benchmark data sets (ShanghaiTech, UCF-Crime, XD-Violence and UCSD-Peds) and (ii) achieves significantly improved subtle anomaly discriminability and sample efficiency.

AB  - The safety lifetime analysis under the constraint of a required time-dependent failure probability is of great significance to ensure the structural safety, and the vital point in safety lifetime analysis is efficiently estimating the time-dependent failure probability in any subinterval of the time interval of interest. For addressing this issue, a new single-loop Kriging method is proposed by considering the first failure instant, and a new learning function is constructed for selecting the most contributing candidate point to accurately recognize the first failure instant. Then the Kriging model can converge to accurately recognize the first failure instant. By this convergent Kriging model, the time-dependent failure probability in any subinterval of the time interval of interest can be estimated accurately, and then the safety lifetime can be obtained by dichotomy search directly. According to the strategy of identifying the first failure instant of each input sample, the proposed method is more efficient than the existing method named the single-loop adaptive sampling Kriging surrogate model. Three examples are used to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Uncertainties widely existing in composite structures make the reliability and sensitivity analysis highly necessary. In this work, the approach based on adaptive Kriging is discussed to estimate the failure probability, local and global sensitivity of composite structures. The local sensitivity can measure how the local perturbations of the distribution parameters of input variables affect the structural reliability, while the global sensitivity can measure the contributions of input variables to the reliability over their entire uncertainty ranges. The response model such as finite element model of a composite structure is approximated by the Kriging model, which is adaptively updated by the U learning function. Then the Kriging model is combined with numerical simulation for reliability and sensitivity analysis. A composite beam with explicit response function and a composite plate is analyzed to test the accuracy and efficiency of the Kriging based approach. Then a composite radome which is used for aeronautical purposes is analyzed. The reliability of the radome is obtained, and those input parameters that are important to the radome reliability are identified. The adaptive Kriging based approach offers a viable tool for reliability evaluation of composite structures.

AB  - Bayesian model updating provides a powerful framework for updating and uncertainty quantification of models by making use of observations, following probability rules in the treatment of uncertainty. Particle filter (PF) and Bayesian Updating with Structural Reliability method (BUS) have been developed by researchers as promising computational tools for this purpose. However, reducing computational cost in the updating process, especially for complex models, remains one of the key challenges. Surrogate model approach achieves this by appropriately replacing, possibly adaptively, the evaluation of the original computationally costly models with approximate ones that are much less costly. This study proposes an efficient method to estimate the posterior probability density function (PDF) of model parameters by using a surrogate model constructed using adaptive Gaussian Process Regression and PF. Of critical importance is the development of 'learning function', which finds the location of large values of posterior PDF and avoids those that have been visited. The proposed methodology is illustrated using a single-variable example and compared with PF and BUS. Its application is illustrated through an example of structural dynamics and another one on settlement prediction by soil-water coupled FEM with Cam-clay model.

AB  - The use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to make daily weather predictions based on historical data is proposed in this study. The proposed models are designed using four learning algorithms: feedforward backpropagation, cascade forward backpropagation, feedforward distributed time delay, and layer recurrence. Moreover, the four learning algorithms use TRAINLM, TRAINRP, TRAINSCG, TRAINGDX, and TRAINOSS training functions independently. Weather data of 5500 days were used for training, validating, and testing using the designed networks. By measuring the atmospheric minimum and maximum temperatures, relative humidity, precipitation, sunshine hours, and wind speed on each day, the weather data of the next day, that is, the maximum temperature of the atmosphere and sunshine hours, were forecast. The network architecture is composed of 1 hidden layer and 12 neurons. The feedforward backpropagation neural network achieved a better result than the other neural networks. The numerical predictions of the feedforward backpropagation neural network were nearly equal to the actual values, and its forecast was responsible for a mean square error of less than 2.11 for the overall training. During the training, validation and testing phase the recorded regression were 0.99109, 0.98298 and 0.99184, respectively. The aggregated regression value considering training, validation, and testing was 0.98955.

AB  - The Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) is a critical metric for assessing the reliability of non-repairable systems, and it plays a significant role in incident management. However, accurately estimating MTTF can be challenging due to the limited availability and quality of historical experimental data on a group of identical parts or systems. To address this challenge, we propose an adaptive surrogate modeling method, which approximate the system's performance functions with a more computationally efficient model to predict the MTTF during the design stage. In this paper, we develop an adaptive Gaussian process (GP) approach that combines with Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) to predict MTTF. The proposed method initially trains a GP model for the system's performance function, and then an MTTF surrogate model can be obtained. With a learning function, these models are updated dynamically based on new information as it becomes available. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on series system, parallel system, and mixed system with two examples, and the results show that the adaptive surrogate modeling method can accurately predict the MTTF of the system. Our method has the potential to improve the reliability and safety of complex system and reduces the need for costly performance testing.

AB  - As a major national asset for promoting social development, volunteer groups have grown rapidly worldwide and have brought significant benefits to individuals, communities, and society in general. Volunteering is encouraged and common among Muslims in the Middle East, but there is rare study on why they volunteer. This study used multiple regression to explore what motivates Saudi male university students to volunteer with a sample of 223 subjects. The results show that all predictor variables such as pro-social personality, values function, career function, social function, enhancement function, protective function, and learning function of volunteering, community identity, institutional facilitation, and Islamic cultural motivation, are statistically significantly correlated to students' volunteering intentions, but these factors contribute to the ordinary least square regression model at different levels. Only career (B = 0.217), social (B = 0.212), learning (B = 0.280), and enhancement functions (B = 0.230) of volunteering have statistically significant influence on Saudi university male students' volunteering intention. Findings highlight a need for a focus on instrumental needs of volunteers by government and NGOs. In regards to future research, gender and educational impacts on volunteers' motive should be explored.

AB  - A method for predicting the five species contents of cadmium was developed by combining the back-propagation artificial neural network with graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry(BP-ANN-GF-AAS). Based on the strong learning function and the features of the information distributed storage of artificial neural network(ANN), a single ANN was constituted in which only one determination point of every sample was required. The exchangeable, carbonated, Fe-Mn oxidable, organic and residual species of cadmium for 20 kinds of soil samples from the two sections of Changchun(China) were determined by BP-ANN-GF-AAS. The detection limit of the method is 0.024 mu g/L and the limit of quantification is 0.080 mu g/L. t-Test indicates that there is not any systemic error of the results obtained by the Tessier sequential extraction graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry method(Tessier -GF-AAS) and BP-ANN-GF-AAS. Compared with those of the Tessier-GF-AAS, the prediction errors of BP-ANN-GF-AAS are less than 10%. The proposed method is fast, convenient, sensitive, and can eliminate the interference among various species.

AB  - The safety level of structure with fuzzy uncertainties can be measured by failure possibility. The traditional combining the adaptive Kriging with fuzzy simulation method rely heavily on sampling efficiency, and a large number of samples in whole fuzzy domain needed to be generated, but only the samples belong to failure domain contribute significantly to the failure possibility estimation, which greatly increases the computational cost. In order to improve the sampling efficiency, a novel line sampling based fuzzy simulation combined with adaptive Kriging method is proposed in this paper. In the proposed method, the samples generated by fuzzy simulation are searched along the important direction, and the intersection points between each line and limit state surface are determined by doubleloop three-point quadratic polynomial interpolation, so as to acquire higher sampling efficiency. Then the Kriging model is trained by the learning function based on the maximizing the mean square error to accurately determined the intersection points. By introducing Kriging model, the number of real performance function calls is reduced and the computational efficiency is greatly improved. Three test examples and a simplified turbine disk illustrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.(c) 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Postnatal development of the cerebellum is critical for its intact function such as motor coordination and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. We previously reported that deprivation of secretin (SCT) from cerebellar Purkinje neurons impaired motor coordination and motor learning function, while leaving the potential role of SCT in cerebellar development to be determined. SCT and its receptor (SCTR) were constitutively expressed in the postnatal cerebellum in a temporal and cell-specific manner. Using a SCT knockout mouse model, we provided direct evidence showing altered developmental patterns of Purkinje cells (PCs) and granular cells (GCs). SCT deprivation reduced the PC density, impaired the PC dendritic formation, induced accelerated GC migration and potentiated cerebellar apoptosis. Furthermore, our results indicated the involvement of protein kinase A (PKA) and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways in SCT-mediated protective effects against neuronal apoptosis. Results of this study illustrated a novel function of SCT in the postnatal development of cerebellum, emphasizing the necessary role of SCT in cerebellar-related functions.

AB  - Event factuality prediction is the task of assessing the degree to which an event mentioned in a sentence has happened. However, existing methods usually stack encoders to make factuality predictions given the gold positions of anchor words. In addition, the frequently used encoders, such as bidirectional LSTMS and graph convolution networks, ignore the directional labeled syntactic information while modeling the context. To fill the gap when facing plain text without identifying event anchor words in advance, we investigate the task of end-to-end EFP in this paper. We present the Directional Labeled Graph Recurrent Network, denoted as DLGRN, to solve Event Anchor Detection and Factuality Induction in a multi-task framework. Specifically, we represent sentences as syntactic information graphs. Then, to incorporate directional labeled information, we design edge-tied weights and edge-aware attention mechanism on top of a graph-based recurrently message passing encoder. We further propose to utilize multi-task learning to jointly model Event Anchor Detection and Factuality Induction by optimizing a mixed-objective learning function. We use four widely used factuality prediction benchmarks (i.e., FactBank, Meantime, UW, and UDS-IH2) to evaluate our framework. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results in the two subtasks, averagely decreasing 17.12% MAE and raising 5.40% Pearson correlation r against the best baseline. In addition, experimental results show that our framework can capture the overall factuality score distributions, and incorporating directional and labeled syntactic information in EFP achieves better performances than the baselines.

AB  - Enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the system reliability analysis of soil slopes is of great importance in engineering design. An advanced kriging metamodel integrated with the quasi-Monte Carlo simulation (AKQMCS) is proposed for such a purpose in this paper. The proposed advanced kriging model is used as a surrogate for the limit state function (LSF) of a slope, and it is established by a sequential design of experiments, which updates the kriging model step by step, with the help of a learning function based on the entropy theory. QMCS simulation is then performed on the advanced kriging metamodel to evaluate the system failure probability of the slope. Finally, three soil slope examples, including a two-layered cohesive slope, a three-layered c-phi slope, and a single-layered sand slope, are examined to verify the capability and validity of the proposed approach. The results indicate that the proposed approach can provide a reasonable and accurate estimation of the system failure probability of slope stability with a significantly reduced number of deterministic stability analyses compared with the ordinary kriging method and the direct Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The QMCS well outperforms the MCS in efficiency due to the low-discrepancy sequences used in the QMCS. Hence, the proposed AKQMCS provides a new and efficient tool for the system reliability analysis of soil slopes. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

KW  - DESIGN OPTIMIZATION
AB  - Surrogate models have been proven to be powerful tools to alleviate the computational burden of structural reliability analysis. An appropriate surrogate model can guarantee prediction accuracy with limited samples. However, the traditional single modeling technique ignores the model-form uncertainty due to insufficient knowledge of the physical system, leading to unreliable prediction results or time-consuming computation. To overcome the aforementioned deficiencies, an active learning ensemble surrogate model under the framework of Bayesian inference is proposed for structural reliability analysis. Based on the derived Bayesian posterior distribution of the predicted response, a learning function integrating the modified U function and the distance information between design points is developed to sequentially select the next point. Besides, in order to further enhance the computational efficiency, we propose an adaptive method to identify the sampling region according to the prediction uncertainty of the estimated limit state surface. Five benchmark examples are employed to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Comparison results show that the proposed active learning reliability analysis method based on the Bayesian ensemble surrogate model can greatly reduce the computational expense with a competitive prediction accuracy. Taking the 10-bar truss problem as an example, compared with AK-MCS+U, ALR-Bpce, and ALR-SVR, the improved rate of the proposed method in efficiency is 51.58%, 12.78%, and 25.96%, respectively. Meanwhile, its prediction accuracy is high and much better than ALR-ELSM. In addition, the superior performance is robust in a wide range of application cases.

AB  - In practice, a vital challenge problem is how to accurately evaluate the failure probability of rare events with a minimum of samples. Although adaptive Kriging combined with truncated importance sampling (AK-TIS) provides a viable method to address this problem, unsatisfied samples are often added in Kriging modeling and thereby result in an unacceptable computing burden. To efficiently acquire best-desired samples and reduce the calls of real limit state function (LSF), a moving-zone renewal (MZR) strategy-based AK-TIS (MZR-AK-TIS) approach is proposed. By dividing the whole large candidate sampling pool into several small sub-candidate sampling pools, the MZR strategy can ceaselessly find desired samples and update the Kriging model as the moving of the sub-sampling pool. MZR-AK-TIS not only inherits the advantages of AK-TIS but also reduces its computing time in two aspects. One is the size reduction of the candidate sampling pool in each sub-zone, and the other is the reduction of the call number of real LSF since the samples outside the sub-sampling pool do not need to participate in Kriging updating. The proposed method is verified by several numerical cases and applied to the aeroengine variable stator vane mechanism. The analysis results demonstrate that MZR-AK-TIS holds the potential to reduce the computing cost while ensuring accuracy in rare event analysis.

AB  - Agent-based modeling has become a beneficial tool in describing the complex and intelligent decision-making behaviors of military logistics entities, which is essential in exploring military logistics system. A challenging task in this field is the learning behavior modeling of military logistics agents. Profit sharing (PS) reinforcement learning algorithm is a representative exploitation-oriented method describing empirical reinforcement learning mechanism, and has been successfully applied to a variety of real-world problems. However, constructing the learning behavior model of military logistics agents is difficult by merely using the original PS algorithm. This difficulty is due to the actual characteristics of equipment support operations and military requirements, such as experience sharing, cooperative action, and hierarchical control. To address this issue, we propose an improved PS algorithm by introducing cooperative task reward correction parameters, experience sharing learning function, and superior command controlled function. We use the research methodology centering on the basic process of the improved PS algorithm as basis to construct the architecture of the learning behavior model of military logistics agents and its corresponding model of elements. Furthermore, we design the implementation algorithm of the learning behavior model. Lastly, we conduct a case study of a tactical military industrial logistics simulation system, thereby verifying the feasibility and effectiveness of the learning behavior model. We find that the improved PS algorithm and corresponding learning behavior model have more advantages than the original PS algorithm. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Traditional approaches to assessment in health professions education systems, which have generally focused on the summative function of assessment through the development and episodic use of individual high -stakes examinations, may no longer be appropriate in an era of competency based medical education. Contemporary assessment programs should not only ensure collection of high -quality performance data to support robust decision -making on learners' achievement and competence development but also facilitate the provision of meaningful feedback to learners to support reflective practice and performance improvement. Programmatic assessment is a specific approach to designing assessment systems through the intentional selection and combination of a variety of assessment methods and activities embedded within an educational framework to simultaneously optimize the decision -making and learning function of assessment. It is a core component of competency based medical education and is aligned with the goals of promoting assessment for learning and coaching learners to achieve predefined levels of competence. In Canada, postgraduate specialist medical education has undergone a transformative change to a competency based model centred around entrustable professional activities (EPAs). In this paper, we describe and reflect on the large scale, national implementation of a program of assessment model designed to guide learning and ensure that robust data is collected to support defensible decisions about EPA achievement and progress through training. Reflecting on the design and implications of this assessment system may help others who want to incorporate a competency based approach in their own country.

AB  - Reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) traditionally relies primarily on high-fidelity and computationally expensive simulations to search for and evaluate design solutions. However, significant disparities could emerge for complex nonlinear behavior that are challenging for numerical modeling. In contrast to mitigating the impact of inaccurate numerical modeling through optimization algorithms, laboratory experiments realistically capture the complex nonlinear behavior of structures or their components. Real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) is widely considered as an efficient and cost-effective technique for integrating numerical modeling with experimental testing for structural response evaluation. This study proposes an innovative framework that utilizes RTHS for the performance assessment of candidate designs to enable RBDO of structures subjected to pulse-like ground motions. RTHS tests are conducted to physically evaluate structural responses through realistically replicating complex nonlinear behavior of experimental substructures. This study introduces a novel penalty function-based efficient global optimization (P-EGO) method to minimize the required number of laboratory tests through surrogating the response quantities of interest derived from RTHS. The proposed framework is experimentally evaluated for design optimization of a two-story four-bay steel moment-resisting frame with self-centering viscous dampers subjected to pulse-like ground motions. The results demonstrate innovative application of RTHS in dynamic optimal design to account for uncertainties. It offers an effective and efficient alternative for traditional RBDO through pure computational simulation, particularly when structural components pose challenges for numerical modeling.

AB  - The purpose of time -dependent reliability analysis is evaluating the reliability of a system or component within a specified timeframe. Several approaches have been suggested for addressing time -dependent reliability challenges, including analytical methods and methods based on response surrogate models. As a representative of Machine Learning methods, the Active Learning Gaussian process model has gained more and more popularity in time -dependent reliability analysis. In practical applications, certain uncertainties may not be adequately represented by random variables following deterministic distributions. In contrast, these uncertainties can be easily described by interval variables. This article introduces an innovative method based on Active Learning Gaussian process modeling for time -dependent reliability analysis, encompassing both random and interval variables. The initial step involves transforming stochastic processes into random parameters through spectral decomposition. Moreover, a new sampling strategy to manage mixed uncertainties is proposed, where the candidate samples of mixed variables with positive maximum extreme responses and negative minimum extreme responses are identified. These samples are utilized to construct and renew an extreme Gaussian process model. Lastly, we present an improved confidence -based learning function to accelerate the learning process, which is designed to locate the optimal random input and interval input for updating the extreme Gaussian process model. One mathematical example and two engineering examples are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed method. Results illustrate that our method offers high accuracy while reducing the evaluations of true performance functions in addressing time -dependent reliability issues under mixed uncertainties.

AB  - As the main performance self-evaluation index of the Kalman filter, the estimation error covariance (EEC) has been used to design the allocation cost function of task and resources for sensor tracking networks. For nonlinear systems, the sensor allocation method based on the EEC needs to adjust the allocation plans after obtaining the filtering results. Meanwhile, recent investigations have indicated that the self-evaluation function EEC of the Kalman filtering is universally inapplicable in practical applications, for which the estimation models are generally mismatched due to difficulty in accurately training parameters and approximation of nonlinear systems. Thereby, the sensors cannot be properly allocated by using the EEC as a preliminary criterion. Alternatively, observable degree (OD) is a naturally quantitative measure on observability and can be utilized to effectively measure the estimation performance. In this paper, the OD analysis with scale transform invariance for nonlinear systems is studied by using the unscented Kalman filter, the pseudostate transition matrix, and the pseudo observation matrix on the basis of the results of linear systems. Afterward, the OD of nonlinear fusion systems, the sensor utilization efficiency, the priority of tasks, and the sensor performance and sensitivity are jointly considered to formulate the optimization problem for sensor allocation. The genetic algorithm with intelligent learning function is employed to solve the optimization problem. Moreover, extensive simulation demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed approach.

AB  - Artificial neural network (ANN) models have been designed to predict faecal coliform and total coliform removal for an intermittent cycle extended aeration-sequential batch reactor (ICEAS-SBR). Wastewater influent pH, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), oil & grease (O&G), total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), ammonical nitrogen (AN), total phosphorus (TP), faecal coliform, and total coliform were used to develop the network. The data used to train and test the network were obtained from the Jamnagar municipal corporation-waste water treatment plant (JMC-WWTP). Feedforward backpropagation algorithm with learngdm learning function was used to develop ANN models. The number of neurons in hidden layer were varied between 2-10 to find the most reliable network. The optimum ANN models were selected for faecal coliform and total coliform on trial-and-error method. The performance of designed models was tested by computing correlation coefficient, mean absolute deviation (MAD), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The network with 6 hidden neurons was optimum for faecal coliform, and 8 hidden neurons was optimum for total coliform. The produced simulation results were within 5 % of MAPE for both faecal and total coliform. The ANN models allow faecal coliform and total coliform levels in the treated wastewater effluent to be regulated that reduces the public and in particular the oyster consumer's health risks.

AB  - Federated Learning (FL) aims to improve machine learning privacy by allowing several data owners in edge and ubiquitous computing systems to collaboratively train a model, while preserving their local training data private, and sharing only model training parameters. However, FL systems remain vulnerable to privacy attacks, and in particular, to membership inference attacks that allow adversaries to determine whether a given data sample belongs to participants' training data, thus, raising a significant threat in sensitive ubiquitous computing systems. Indeed, membership inference attacks are based on a binary classifier that is able to differentiate between member data samples used to train a model and non-member data samples not used for training. In this context, several defense mechanisms, including differential privacy, have been proposed to counter such privacy attacks. However, the main drawback of these methods is that they may reduce model accuracy while incurring non-negligible computational costs. In this paper, we precisely address this problem with PASTEL, a FL privacy-preserving mechanism that is based on a novel multi-objective learning function. On the one hand, PASTEL decreases the generalization gap to reduce the difference between member data and non-member data, and on the other hand, PASTEL reduces model loss and leverages adaptive gradient descent optimization for preserving high model accuracy. Our experimental evaluations conducted on eight widely used datasets and five model architectures show that PASTEL significantly reduces membership inference attack success rates by up to -28%, reaching optimal privacy protection in most cases, with low to no perceptible impact on model accuracy.

AB  - Reliability analysis can be particularly challenging when performance functions require time-consuming simulations. Such simulations often involve multiple fidelity sources. This paper aims to enhance the efficiency of reliability analysis by leveraging multiple sample datasets with varying sources of fidelity. Firstly, this paper extends the GP model to integrate multiple low fidelity data into high fidelity predictions. In order to consider the correlations among data from different fidelity sources, the latent space representation from LMGP is introduced into the correlation matrix of different fidelity data. This multi-fidelity GP model is referred to as a latent map multi-fidelity Kriging (LMmfK). The effectiveness of LMmfK is validated through 1-dimensional analytical test and 8-dimensional Borehole test. Secondly, based on LMmfK, this paper proposes an active learning point-selected strategy suitable for scenarios with multiple fidelity sources, referred to as mfUEFF. The mfUEFF strategy intelligently selects the best data points from multiple fidelity sources, leveraging the benefits of both global improvement and local uncertainty. This integration enhances the efficiency and accuracy of reliability analysis. Two classic cases demonstrate that the proposed reliability method demonstrates superior computational accuracy and efficiency compared to other reliability methods. Finally, this paper applies the proposed method to the static reliability analysis of gears, involving time-consuming finite element models. Engineering application demonstrates that this method significantly improves efficiency, especially in scenarios with multiple fidelity sources.

AB  - Introduction Programmatic assessment is a longitudinal, developmental approach that fosters and harnesses the learning function of assessment. Yet the implementation, a critical step to translate theory into practice, can be challenging. As part of the Ottawa 2020 consensus statement on programmatic assessment, we sought to provide descriptions of the implementation of the 12 principles of programmatic assessment and to gain insight into enablers and barriers across different institutions and contexts. Methods After the 2020 Ottawa conference, we surveyed 15 Health Profession Education programmes from six different countries about the implementation of the 12 principles of programmatic assessment. Survey responses were analysed using a deductive thematic analysis. Results and Discussion A wide range of implementations were reported although the principles remained, for the most part, faithful to the original enunciation and rationale. Enablers included strong leadership support, ongoing faculty development, providing students with clear expectations about assessment, simultaneous curriculum renewal and organisational commitment to change. Most barriers were related to the need for a paradigm shift in the culture of assessment. Descriptions of implementations in relation to the theoretical principles, across multiple educational contexts, coupled with explanations of enablers and barriers, provided new insights and a clearer understanding of the strategic and operational considerations in the implementation of programmatic assessment. Future research is needed to further explore how contextual and cultural factors affect implementation.

AB  - Reliability analysis has been widely used in engineering problems to determine the probability of failure of a system by considering its inputs as random variables. An important issue in reliability analysis is to keep to a minimum the number of performance function calls at the desired level of accuracy. Adaptive strategies for coupling sampling-based method and Kriging have been proposed, which allows refining the metamodel construction based on learning functions until a predefined level of accuracy is satisfied. Regarding convergence criteria, which are used to terminate the training of surrogate models, it is important to estimate expected reduction of the reliability by considering an untried sample. This study aims to provide robust information that helps a user decide whether an additional performance function call is necessary compared to the computational cost from a reliability perspective before performing the simulation. This paper first proposes the expected reliability analysis method by considering the posterior distribution of an untried sample. Then, the confidence interval of reliability (CIR) and confidence interval of expected reliability (CIER) are defined to quantify the expected uncertainty reduction of reliability (EURR). Finally, two numerical examples and Korean electrical multiple units (K-EMU) carbody engineering example are introduced to verify the robustness of the proposed adaptive sampling convergence criterion EURR.

AB  - Microglia play a critical role in the clearance of myelin debris, thereby ensuring functional recovery from neural injury. Here, using mouse model of demyelination following two-point LPC injection, we show that the microglial autophagic-lysosomal pathway becomes overactivated in response to severe demyelination, leading to lipid droplet accumulation and a dysfunctional and pro-inflammatory microglial state, and finally failed myelin debris clearance and spatial learning deficits. Data from genetic approaches and pharmacological modulations, via microglial Atg5 deficient mice and intraventricular BAF A1 administration, respectively, demonstrate that staged suppression of excessive autophagic-lysosomal activation in microglia, but not sustained inhibition, results in better myelin debris degradation and exerts protective effects against demyelination. Combined multi-omics results in vitro further showed that enhanced lipid metabolism, especially the activation of the linoleic acid pathway, underlies this protective effect. Supplementation with conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), both in vivo and in vitro, could mimic these effects, including attenuating inflammation and restoring microglial pro -regenerative properties, finally resulting in better recovery from demyelination injuries and improved spatial learning function, by activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-& gamma;) pathway. Therefore, we propose that pharmacological inhibition targeting microglial autophagic-lysosomal overactivation or supplementation with CLA could represent a potential therapeutic strategy in demyelinated disorders.

AB  - In reliability analysis for the practical engineering problems with the time-consuming model, it has become an important challenge that how to obtain accurate reliability assessment with a minimum number of calls. In order to reduce the computational cost, this paper develops a new sequential surrogate method combining adaptive kriging and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation with a novel learning strategy for reliability analysis. The proposed method is named AK-MCMC, which takes full advantage of the classification feature of reliability analysis based on the surrogate models, and it can efficiently approximate the classification boundary of the performance function. First, the learning strategy is developed to sequentially pick out the informative samples for updating the experimental design samples. Then, a new stopping criterion is adopted to guarantee the classification accuracy of the constructed kriging model. In this way, the proposed method skillfully makes reliability evaluation independent of an adaptive iterative process, which greatly improves the efficiency of model refinement. Finally, the proposed method is applied to several examples, which contain small failure probability problem, non-linearity problem, and engineering problem with an implicit performance function. In particular, the efficiency of the proposed AK-MCMC method is proved for the problems with small failure probability.

AB  - For addressing the low efficiency of structural reliability analysis under the random-interval mixed uncertainties (RIMU), this paper establishes the line sampling method (LS) under the RIMU. The proposed LS divides the reliability analysis under RIMU into two stages. The Markov chain simulation is used to efficiently search the design point under RIMU in the first stage, then the upper and lower bounds of failure probability are estimated by LS in the second stage. To improve the computational efficiency of the proposed LS under RIMU, the Kriging model is employed to reduce the model evaluation numbers in the two stages. For efficiently searching the design point, the Kriging model is constructed and adaptively updated in the first stage to accurately recognize the Markov chain candidate state, and then it is sequentially updated by the improved U learning function in the second stage to accurately estimate the failure probability bounds. The proposed LS under RIMU with Kriging model can not only reduce the model evaluation numbers but also decrease the candidate sample pool size for constructing the Kriging model in two stages. The presented examples demonstrate the superior computational efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method by comparison with some existing methods.

AB  - Mastication is an indispensable oral function related to physical, mental, and social health throughout life. The elderly tend to have a masticatory dysfunction due to tooth loss and fragility in the masticatory muscles with aging, potentially resulting in impaired cognitive function. Masticatory stimulation has influence on the development of the central nervous system (CNS) as well as the growth of maxillofacial tissue in children. Although the relationship between mastication and cognitive function is potentially important in the growth period, the cellular and molecular mechanisms have not been sufficiently elucidated. Here, we show that the reduced mastication resulted in impaired spatial memory and learning function owing to the morphological change and decreased activity in the hippocampus. We used an in vivo model for reduced masticatory stimuli, in which juvenile mice were fed with powder diet and found that masticatory stimulation during the growth period positively regulated long-term spatial memory to promote cognitive function. The functional linkage between mastication and brain was validated by the decrease in neurons, neurogenesis, neuronal activity, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the hippocampus. These findings taken together provide in vivo evidence for a functional linkage between mastication and cognitive function in the growth period, suggesting a need for novel therapeutic strategies in masticatory function-related cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - Recently, multitask learning has been successfully applied to survival analysis problems. A critical challenge in real-world survival analysis tasks is that not all instances and tasks are equally learnable. A survival analysis model can be improved when considering the complexities of instances and tasks during the model training. To this end, we propose an asymmetric graph-guided multitask learning approach with self-paced learning for survival analysis applications. The proposed model is able to improve the learning performance by identifying the complex structure among tasks and considering the complexities of training instances and tasks during the model training. Especially, by incorporating the self-paced learning strategy and asymmetric graph-guided regularization, the proposed model is able to learn the model in a progressive way from "easy" to "hard" loss function items. In addition, together with the self-paced learning function, the asymmetric graph-guided regularization allows the related knowledge transfer from one task to another in an asymmetric way. Consequently, the knowledge acquired from those earlier learned tasks can help to solve complex tasks effectively. The experimental results on both synthetic and real-world TCGA data suggest that the proposed method is indeed useful for improving survival analysis and achieves higher prediction accuracies than the previous state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Permanent grasslands play a very important role in the landscape. The loss of permanent grasslands and their subsequent conversion into arable land create erosion-prone agricultural areas in the landscape and have a negative impact on the biodiversity. From this point of view, there is a need for the accurate and effective monitoring of changes in the agricultural landscape along with an assessment of the influence of the agricultural policies on the landscape. Sentinel-2 from the Copernicus programme has improved options for the implementation of remote sensing data into the monitoring of agricultural land. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of H2O library and within implemented Automachine learning function (AutoML) and its stacked ensembles for mapping changes from grasslands to arable lands. All results show high overall accuracy from 93.5% to 96.6% and high values of area under the ROC curve (0.94-0.98). Stacked ensembles appear to be the most accurate machine learning models for mapping changes from grasslands to arable lands. The importance of several biological predictors has been tested (FAPAR, FCOVER, LAI, NDVI, etc.) with the help of a heatmap that is part of AutoML function of H2O library.

AB  - Active learning strategy combined with single-loop Kriging method has attracted much attention for Timedependent Reliability Analysis (TRA). Large sample pool across all time instants is required to comprehensively cover the failure surface. Identifying training samples with most existing methods requires assessing the response of the entire sample pool, leading to high time costs. Similarly, to assist in identifying critical sampling regions, evaluating failure probability with a large sample pool in each iteration is also time-consuming. Additionally, higher-order uncertainty information is typically ignored, impairing the sampling efficiency. To address these issues, a Subdomain Uncertainty-guided Kriging (SUK) Method is proposed. Stochastic processes are first equivalently converted to random variables. By simultaneously sampling random variables and time parameter, an equivalent sample pool with significantly reduced size is generated for adaptive sampling. With a concise subdomain uncertainty assessment function, critical sampling region, i.e. sensitive subdomain, is distinguished efficiently. By comprehensively considering both the expectation and standard deviation of feasibility function, a novel Optimized Feasibility Metric (OFM) is then proposed for active learning. The proportion of misclassified samples is analytically deduced as stopping criterion. Finally, comparison results on four examples demonstrate the good performances of the proposed subdomain uncertainty-guided Kriging method.

AB  - Surrogate model-based reliability analysis methods, especially the adaptive Kriging model, have received increasing attention due to their high accuracy and efficiency for reliability analysis. In the context of the practical engineering and a design target of high reliability, the adaptive Kriging is combined with more efficient sampling techniques such as the spherical decomposition-based Monte Carlo simulation (SDMCS). In this paper, a new stopping criterion is tailored for the adaptive Kriging model with SDMCS (AKSDMCS). The relative error of the failure probability obtained by AKSDMCS is first derived. Then, the effect of samples with high probabilities of wrong classification on the relative error of failure probability is quantified. In each sub-region of SDMCS, it can be found that the number of points in wrong classification follows a binomial distribution. The expected upper bound of the relative error of the failure probability is subsequently formulated. Finally, a new stopping criterion designed for AKSDMCS is developed. Three applications are used to validate the performance of the proposed stopping criterion and the results showcase that the adaptive Kriging with the proposed stopping criterion can stop the active training process at an appropriate stage and significantly mitigate the computational effort of rare event estimation.

AB  - Seismic Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Assessment (SPTHA) is a framework for calculating the probability that seismically induced tsunami waves exceed a specific threshold height, over a given time span and a specific region (i.e. regional SPTHA) or site (i.e. local SPTHA). To account for the uncertainty of the possible sources, SPTHA must integrate the results of a large number of computationally demanding tsunami simulations
   In this work, we innovatively use Parallel density scanned Adaptive Kriging (P-ds AK) to overcome the computational efficiency challenge of local SPTHA within a framework that consists in modeling/retrieving the full spectrum of possible earthquake triggering events at the regional level, filtering sources not relevant for the target, adopting a clustering procedure to select "representative scenarios" for inundation modeling, and, finally, adopt P-ds AK to identify the clusters centroids that most influence the hazard intensity (i.e., wave height) in the areas of interest.
   This approach is applied in the area of the oil refinery located in Milazzo (Italy). The application shows a consistent reduction of the number of high-resolution tsunami simulations required for the evaluation of the hazard curves over a set of inland Point of Interest (Pots), either concentrated in one specific area or distributed along the coast.

AB  - This study presents an unsupervised learning instance segmentation methodology using self-supervised learning Vision Transformer (ViT) and K-means methodology. The proposed instance segmentation is attracting attention as a core field of computer vision that assigns all pixels of an image to an appropriate class and localizes objects to bounding boxes. However, the task of producing high-accuracy pixel-level labels is more important than image classification and object detection. It requires high costs and a lot of time. Therefore, this study provides a clear and easy-to-understand explanation for the personalized decision-making process by using an iterative object mask refinement technique that performs class agnostic unsupervised instance segmentation using K-means clustering and self-adaptive supervised learned ViT. do. The proposed method generates pseudo labels that can be used to learn commercial instance segmentation models. The generated pseudo labels have higher accuracy than other methodologies, and the instance segmentation model learned with pseudo labels improves the existing highest performance by more than 50-80%. Therefore, in this study, without changing the structure of the learning function or model, we proposed a personalized ViT recommendation algorithm through single object discovery, multi-object discovery, and supervised learning segmentation using K-means, a simple clustering methodology, and self-supervised learning ViT.

However, whether Humanin-S14G ameliorates VD through miR-134 remains poorly understood. Healthy male rats were assigned into sham group; VD group and Humanin-S14G group followed by analysis of learning ability by the Morris water maze test, expression of miR-134, Bcl-2 and Bax by Real time PCR, BDNF protein level by Western blot, IL-6 secretion by ELISA as well as pathological changes of hippocampal nerve region by HE staining. In VD model group, the learning and cognitive ability of the rats was significantly decreased and miR134 and IL-6 was significantly upregulated along with downregulated Bcl-2 and BDNF and upregulated Bax expression compared to sham group (P < 0.05). Humanin-S14G significantly improved the learning and cognitive ability of VD model rats, decreased miR-134 and IL-6 level, increased Bcl-2 and BDNF expression, as well as inhibited Bax expression (P < 0.05) and nerve damage was significantly improved. Humanin-S14G regulates miR-134 expression in the brain tissue of VD rats, promote the expression of BDNF, regulate cell apoptosis, inhibit inflammation, improve the learning function of vascular dementia, and delay the occurrence and development of vascular dementia.

AB  - Estimating fatigue damage in wind turbine structures over their lifetime is a time-demanding task, necessitating simulations encompassing all the wind and wave conditions. Typically, this involves expending several thousand hours in simulation efforts. Given formidable computational demand, this study proposes an efficient active learning Kriging approach named ALK-EFDA for estimating expected fatigue damage in wind turbines. The ALK-EFDA framework leverages a Kriging surrogate model to predict fatigue damage levels across various wind-wave scenarios, and a learning function is designed to reduce Kriging prediction error in the high probability of occurrences of wind-wave cases. An active learning approach is proposed to estimate the expected fatigue damage efficiently. To validate the effectiveness of this approach, we applied it to a 15 MW Semi-submersible floating wind turbine model. The proposed approach estimates the expected short-term fatigue damage of the wind turbine tower and mooring lines. Our findings demonstrate that the ALK-EFDA method efficiently and accurately estimates fatigue damage in wind turbine structures. Compared to simulation methods, the proposed ALK-EFDA approach significantly reduces computational expenses by over 30 times. Furthermore, the absolute error, when compared to simulated results, remains at approximately 1%. This method will be a useful tool for offshore wind turbine designers.

AB  - Some important phenomena and conclusions for structural intelligent health diagnosis are presented, which include: (1) There are some relationships among the global stiffness matrix [K], the mode eigenvalue lambda(j) and the mode-shape [delta phi] in a structure, which are: delta lambda = [phi](j)(T)[delta K][phi](j) and delta lambda(j) <= 0. (2) In a damaged strcuture, both [delta phi] = 0 and [delta lambda] = 0 will not occur at the same time, so the damage of a structure can be completely reflected by the structural dynamic characteristics {phi,lambda}. This discovery gives a positive conclusion to the problem that whether the structural internal dynamic features can be used as the criteria fof the detection and localization of the structural damage. (3) The strain dynamic parameters are usually more sensitive than the displacement parameters to the structural damage. (4) It is feasible to design a mixed-type dynamic. parameter-based structural intelligent health diagnosis system which based on the integration of the generalized genetic algorithm and artificial neural network, and this system can take the advantage of self-learning function of artificial neural network and the global optimization capability of the generalized genetic algorithm. Furthermore, the knowledge base of this system is capable of self-revolution.

AB  - Current state-of-the-art methods for reliability updating with equality information transform this challenging problem into an inequality one by introducing an auxiliary random variable. However, the joint event of information and failure in the derived conditional probabilities is typically very rare, and therefore, very challenging to estimate. Moreover, updating the reliability as new information arrives requires reevaluation of the probability of the joint event, which involves large numbers of calls to performance functions. We address these limitations by proposing a new approach to reliability updating called RUAK. One of the important contributions is the decomposition of the rare joint event of the failure and observed information into two events both with relatively high probabilities. Moreover, an adaptive Kriging-based reliability analysis method is proposed for the estimation of the prior failure probability and the conditional probability of information. This way, reliability updating for new information is conducted using the efficient Kriging meta-model, which significantly enhances the computational efficiency. Results for four examples indicate that the computational demand using RUAK is decreased by two orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art methods, while achieving higher accuracy. This approach facilitates real-time reliability updating for various applications such as health monitoring and warning systems.

AB  - The Kriging-based reliability method with a sequential design of experiments (DoE) has been developed in recent years for implicit limit state functions. Such methods include the efficient global reliability analysis, the active learning reliability method combining Kriging and MCS Simulations. In this research, a novel local approximation method based on the most probable failure point (MPFP) is proposed to improve such methods. In this method, the MPFP calculated in the last iteration is the center of the next sampling region. The size of the local region depends on the reliability index obtained by the First Order Reliability Method (FORM) and the deviation distance of the standard deviation. The proposed algorithm, which approximates the limit state function accurately near MPFP rather than in the whole design space, can avoid selecting samples in regions that have negligible effects on the reliability analysis results. In addition, a multi-point enrichment technique is also introduced to select multiple sample points in each iteration. After the high-quality approximation of limit state function is obtained, the failure probability is calculated by the Monte Carlo method. Four numerical examples are used to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method is very effective for an accurate evaluation of the failure probability.

AB  - The present work discusses an innovative approach to metamodeling in reliability that uses a field-transversal rationale. Adaptive metamodeling in reliability is characterized by its large spectra of models and techniques with different assumptions. As a result, the reliability engineer is frequently faced with the highly challenging task of selecting an appropriate model or technique with limited a priori knowledge about the performance function that defines the problem of reliability.
   To tackle this challenge, a complement-basis is proposed for adaptive metamodeling. It consists in using a batch of multiple metamodels or techniques that, accordingly to an activation criterion, are selected to solve the reliability analysis. This activation is set to depend on the model synergy with the problem in-hand. In the present work the leave-one-out loss is applied as evaluator of compatibility, and results show that the absolute loss successfully performs as an activator.
   A metamodel-independent learning approach and stopping criterion are implemented to study the proposed approach in five representative examples. Results show that the complement-basis allows to increase the efficiency of the reliability analysis through the selection of adequate metamodels, which is indicative of the untapped potential that further transversal research may add to metamodeling in reliability analysis.

AB  - Time variant reliability analysis introduces additional complexity due to the inclusion of time. When the time- variant failure probability function (TFPF) of the structure is of interest, it inherently involves sequential evaluations of the failure probabilities of series systems varied with time in discretized space, posing a challenge to reliability analysis. An efficient approach for the evaluation of the TFPF, called 'Time-dependent Adaptive Support Vector Machine combined with Monte Carlo Simulation' (TASVM-MCS), is presented to reduce the corresponding computational cost. Based on the samples from Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), an iterative strategy is proposed to actively extract the most valuable sample points from the sample pool and iteratively update the support vector machine (SVM) model. In particular, an active learning function is proposed to take into account the diversity of samples and time simultaneously. In this way, the built SVM will be more suitable for the evaluation of TFPF other than a point-wise failure probability. The proposed TASVM-MCS method is relatively less sensitive to the dimensionality of the input variables, making it a powerful and promising approach for time-variant reliability computations. Four representative examples are given to demonstrate the significant effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

AB  - High dimensional reliability analysis is unavoidable if a structural system involving stochastic process because Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) expansion is commonly used. Reliability analysis for structural systems with computationally intensive numerical models and high dimensions is challenging. In this study, an effective high dimensional reliability analysis method is proposed based on principal components and active subspace (PCAS) and active Kriging, and is termed as PCAS-AK. The proposed method can address two shortcomings existing in PCAS: the latter select training samples randomly and cannot deal with parallel processing. The proposed method, however, selects training samples adaptively, subsequently, the training samples that have high contribution to probability of failure are selected, which can improve computational efficiency. To reduce overall computational time and allow parallelization, K-weighted-means combined with learning function are used to select multiple samples at each iteration. After the dimension reduction of both input and output spaces, the samples selected by adaptive method are used to construct Kriging model in the latent low-dimensional space. Three examples are used to demonstrate the applicability and accuracy of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method can deal with parallel processing and is, generally, more effective than PCAS for high dimensional reliability problems.

AB  - For efficiently and accurately estimating the failure probability and the further sensitivity index of the high-dimension structures, a novel AS-AK-MCS method is proposed in this work. This method fully employs the merits of the active subspace-based dimension reduction technique, the active learning (AL) Kriging surrogate model, and the Monte Carlo simulation. In the proposed method, the intractable gradient information needed by the active subspace method is obtained by a crude Kriging model with initial training sample points. In the construction of the crude Kriging model, the proposed trend model selection criterion reduces the man-made error. Then the active subspace method converts the reliability analysis from the original high-dimension space into the low-dimension subspace, which facilities constructing an AL-Kriging model and also avoids the tricky "curse of dimension" problem. The state-of-the-art U learning function is applied as the points adding criterion in the active subspace. In order to demonstrate the effectivity and versatility of the proposed method, three representative examples including the linear/nonlinear and the explicit/implicit performance functions are studied for estimating the failure probability and the failure probability-based sensitivity index. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the reliability and sensitivity analysis of a composite radome structure.

AB  - In nuclear reactor fuel performance simulation, fission gas release (FGR) and swelling involve treatment of several complicated and interrelated physical processes, which inevitably depend on uncertain input parameters. However, the uncertainties associated with these input parameters are only known by "expert judgment". In this paper, inverse Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) under the Bayesian framework is applied to BISON code FGR model based on Riso-AN3 time series experimental data. Inverse UQ seeks statistical descriptions of the uncertain input parameters that are consistent with the available measurement data. It always captures the uncertainties in its estimates rather than merely determining the best-fit values. Kriging metamodel is applied to greatly reduce the computational cost during Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling.
   We performed a dimension reduction for the FGR time series data using Principal Component Analysis. We also projected the original FGR time series measurement data onto the PC subspace as "transformed experiment data". A forward uncertainty propagation based on the posterior distributions shows that the agreement between BISON simulation and Rise-AN3 time series measurement data is greatly improved. The posterior distributions for the uncertain input factors can be used to replace the expert specifications for future uncertainty/sensitivity analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reports produced by popular malware analysis services showed a disparity in samples available for different malware families. The unequal distribution between such classes can be attributed to several factors, such as technological advances and the application domain that seeks to infect a computer virus. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning (DL) algorithms when learning multi-class classification tasks using imbalanced datasets. This can be achieved by updating the learning function such that correct and incorrect predictions performed on the minority class are more rewarded or penalized, respectively. This procedure can be logically implemented by leveraging the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) paradigm through a proper formulation of the Markov decision process (MDP). This paper proposes SINNER, i.e., a DRL-based multi-class classifier that approaches the data imbalance problem at the algorithmic level by exploiting a redesigned reward function, which modifies the traditional MDP model used to learn this task. Based on the experimental results, the proposed formula appears to be successful. In addition, SINNER has been compared to several DL-based models that can handle class skew without relying on data-level techniques. Using three out of four datasets sourced from the existing literature, the proposed model achieved state-of-the-art classification performance.

AB  - The probability of fracture (POF) assessment of complex cracked structures is a difficult task in the reliability assessment of engineering structures. Due to the complexity of structure, balancing efficiency and accuracy is the top concern in POF calculation. In this study, a novel probabilistic solution method called AKNN-MCS (Active learning-based K-Nearest Neighbors-Monte Carlo Simulation) is proposed. Combining the active learning strategy and the KNN algorithm, this method could get accurate POF results using a few samples. In detail, POF calculation is treated as a classification problem. A learning function is proposed to select sample points near the limit state surface. Then the selected sample points are added into training data set T. A convergence criterion is defined to decide when to stop the enrichment of T. Thanks to the above active learning strategy, the trained KNN model could have a great generalization ability with only a few training samples required. The proposed method is validated by POF assessment of a finite thickness plate containing a surface semi-elliptical crack and POF assessment of the CT specimen. Results show that AKNN-MCS is three or four orders of magnitude more efficient than MCS for almost identical POF results.

AB  - Reliability assessment of real-world structures is a significant challenge owing to its complex input variables, extremely low failure probability, and significant computational costs. In recent times, a series of surrogate models with variance reduction techniques have been proposed to address these limitations. However, achieving a balance between estimation accuracy and computational cost still remains challenging. To this end, this study proposes a novel two-stage convergence criterion that merges into the exterior subset simulation (SS) framework and the interior Kriging model to improve the efficiency of the active learning process. Based on the error analysis of the Kriging model, two groups of parameters are established to describe the estimation accuracy, eventually forming a two-stage convergence criterion. The first stage aims to control the hierarchical modeling error for each intermediate conditional failure event, and the second stage is devoted to ensuring the global accuracy of estimation of the final failure probability. To validate the proposed method, four case studies were performed, including three numerical examples with explicit limit state functions and a real-world model of a cracked steel deck with finite element analysis. The results indicate that the proposed method can both ensure accuracy and improve the efficiency of the reliability analysis.

AB  - Line sampling (LS) has proved to be a highly promising advanced simulation technique for assessing small failure probabilities. Despite the great interest in practical engineering applications, many efforts from the research community have been devoted to improving the standard LS. This paper aims at offering some new insights into the LS method, leading to an innovative method, termed 'partially Bayesian active learning line sampling' (PBAL-LS). The problem of evaluating the failure probability integral in the LS method is treated as a Bayesian, rather than frequentist, inference problem, which allows to incorporate our prior knowledge and model the discretization error. The Gaussian process model is used as the prior distribution for the distance function, and the posterior mean, and an upper bound of the posterior variance of the failure probability are derived. Based on the posterior statistics of the failure probability, we also put forward a learning function and a stopping criterion, which enable us to use active learning. Besides, an efficient algorithm is also designed to implement the PBAL-LS method, with the ability to automatically adjust the important direction and efficiently process the lines. Five numerical examples are studied to demonstrate the performance of the proposed PBAL-LS method against several existing methods.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Age represents the highest risk factor for death due to cardiovascular disease. Heart failure (HF) is the most common cardiovascular disease in elder population and it is associated with cognitive impairment (CI), diminishing learning and memory process affecting life quality and mortality in these patients. In HF, CI has been associated with inadequate O-2 supply to the brain; however, an important subset of HF patients displays CI with almost no alteration in cerebral blood flow. Importantly, nothing is known about the pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning CI in HF with no change in brain tissue perfusion. Here, we aimed to study memory performance and learning function in a rodent model of HF that shows no change in blood flow going to the brain. We found that HF rats presented learning impairments and memory loss. In addition, HF rats displayed a decreased level of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling downstream elements in the hippocampus, one pathway implicated largely in aging diseases. Taken together, our results suggest that in HF rats CI is associated with dysfunction of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. The mechanisms involved in the alterations of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in HF and its contribution to the development/maintenance of CI deserves future investigations.

AB  - Glaucoma is an irreversible ocular disease leading to permanent blindness. However, early detection can be effective in slowing or halting the progression of the disease. Physiologically, glaucoma progression is quantified by increased excavation of the optic cup. This progression can be quantified in retinal fundus images via the optic cup to disc ratio (CDR), since in increased glaucomatous neuropathy, the relative size of the optic cup to the optic disc is increased. The ARGALI framework constitutes of various segmentation approaches employing level set, color intensity thresholds and ellipse fitting for the extraction of the optic cup and disc from retinal images as preliminary steps. Following this, different combinations of the obtained results are then utilized to calculate the corresponding CDR values. The individual results are subsequently fused using a neural network. The learning function of the neural network is trained with a set of 100 retinal images For testing, a separate set 40 images is then used to compare the obtained CDR against a clinically graded CDR, and it is shown that the neural network-based result performs better than the individual components, with 96% of the results within intra-observer variability. The results indicate good promise for the further development of ARGALI as a tool for the early detection of glaucoma.

AB  - This article offers an optimal control tracking method using an event-triggered technique and the internal reinforcement Q-learning (IrQL) algorithm to address the tracking control issue of unknown nonlinear systems with multiple agents (MASs). Relying on the internal reinforcement reward (IRR) formula, a Q-learning function is calculated, and then the iteration IRQL method is developed. In contrast to mechanisms triggered by time, an event-triggered algorithm reduces the rate of transmission and computational load, since the controller may only be upgraded when the predetermined triggering circumstances are met. In addition, in order to implement the suggested system, a neutral reinforce-critic-actor (RCA) network structure is created that may assess the indices of performance and online learning of the event-triggering mechanism. This strategy is intended to be data-driven without having in-depth knowledge of system dynamics. We must develop the event-triggered weight tuning rule, which only modifies the parameters of the actor neutral network (ANN) in response to triggering cases. In addition, a Lyapunov-based convergence study of the reinforce-critic-actor neutral network (NN) is presented. Lastly, an example demonstrates the accessibility and efficiency of the suggested approach.

AB  - BackgroundMotherhood is a time of intense physical, psychological, and identity transformation, and body dissatisfaction may emerge through the process of pregnancy, birth, and adaptation to parenting. We present a feasibility trial of the Body Confident Mums Challenge, a program developed by adapting existing, effective interventions that focus on self-compassion and appreciation of body functionality to be specific to mothers.MethodsThe program was delivered using the social learning function in a closed Facebook group. Qualitative evaluation of evidence of change was conducted by gathering individual written reflections posted during the challenge (n=120). Feasibility and acceptability was determined using a feedback survey (n=22).ResultsParticipant's reflective posts indicated that they were embracing self-compassion, and de-prioritising body image concerns during the challenge. Feedback indicated that the program was mostly feasible and acceptable for mothers, with recommendations from some participants relating to slowing the pace of content delivery and reducing the time commitment of the Challenge.ConclusionsThe social media environment may therefore be a useful setting in which to implement brief intervention programs to improve body image and wellbeing.

AB  - The Kriging model for structural reliability analysis applications has attracted much attention within recent years. Several Kriging-based strategies of design of experiments are constructed for structural reliability analysis procedure. However, the quantitative accuracy measure of Kriging is still undesirable. Two accuracy measures are introduced. The first one is further studied through derivation and proposed to quantify accuracy of the Kriging-based estimate of the limit state. This paper treats the target failure probability as a variable with epistemic randomness. The second measure is innovatively defined as the standard deviation of the target failure probability. Combining with Chebyshev's inequality, the second measure is available to construct a lower upper bound of the error of the failure-probability estimate. The joint distribution of performance values at untried points of a given Kriging model is derived and proved, which is indeed essential for computing the innovative accuracy measure because it takes the correlation between performance values of untried points into account. Monte Carlo simulation is employed to compute them with acceptable computational cost. To validate the accuracy measures, four benchmark examples are studied. Results demonstrate the availability of them. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To evaluate the functional reliability of the pyrotechnic igniter in the failure mode of unstable combustion at low temperature, a reliability and reliability sensitivity analysis method based on the combination of an interior ballistic model and Kriging reliability method is proposed. Through the deterministic interior ballistic simulation, the failure mode of low temperature unstable combustion of the pyrotechnic igniter is examined, while the random variables are introduced to establish the ignition nonlinear implicit function of the pyrotechnic igniter. The ignition display function of the pyrotechnic igniter is established by the Kriging model, which avoids the repeated calculation of true limit state function values. This study provides an efficient approach to evaluate the ignition reliability of the pyrotechnic igniter and compared with the traditional Monte Carlo method to verify the accuracy of the results. Finally, reliability-based sensitivity indices are presented to quantify the significance of random parameters. It is shown that the influence of the uncertainties can be precisely described, and the diameter of the nozzle plays a dominant role in ignition reliability. Additionally, ignition experiments of nozzles with different diameters were performed to verify the result of sensitivity. This can further support the detailed design of the pyrotechnic igniter.

AB  - Surface loads imposed on pipelines by illegal buildings in urban areas are common. A surface load can cause ground subsidence and pipeline deformation, as well as accidents such as leakages of oil and gas media and even explosions. In this paper, a pipeline reliability model based on stress-strength interference is established; based on structural reliability theory, the authors analyze the maximum equivalent stress of a pipeline's dangerous section and pipe yield stress. Through the combination of the Kriging model and the method proposed by the Joint Committee of Structural Safety (JC method), the established limit state equation is approximated as a surrogate model, and the non-normal random variables are normalized using the JC method. The reliability indexes of the pipeline in the frame and brick-concrete structures were solved using MATLAB, and the results were verified and compared using the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method. Through calculations, the reliability of the pipeline under the surface load of a frame-structure building was 0.9852, while the reliability of the pipeline under a brick-concrete structure was 0.9998, and the relative error with the MCS method was less than 1%. The method used in this paper has good applicability in analyzing the reliability of pressure-occupied pipeline and has certain reference and guiding significance for practical engineering.

AB  - For engineering, there are two major challenges in reliability analysis. First, to ensure the accuracy of simulation results, mechanical products are usually defined implicitly by complex numerical models that require time-consuming. Second, the mechanical products are fortunately designed with a large safety margin, which leads to a low failure probability. This paper proposes an efficient and high-precision adaptive active learning algorithm based on the Kriging surrogate model to deal with the problems with low failure probability and time-consuming numerical models. In order to solve the problem with multiple failure regions, the adaptive kernel-density estimation is introduced and improved. Meanwhile, a new criterion for selecting points based on the current Kriging model is proposed to improve the computational efficiency. The criterion for choosing the best sampling points considers not only the probability of misjudging the sign of the response value at a point by the Kriging model but also the distribution information at that point. In order to prevent the distance between the selected training points from too close, the correlation between training points is limited to avoid information redundancy and improve the computation efficiency of the algorithm. Finally, the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are verified compared with other algorithms through two academic examples and one engineering application.

AB  - The general goal of this research is the determination natural regular frequency of a plate by artificial neural network with various supporting conditions. For the subject of neural network, training or learning algorithms are applied the most famous of which is back propagation algorithm. This algorithm is a systematic method for training multi layer artificial neural network. Back propagation algorithm is based on gradient descant which means that it moves downward on the error declination and regulates the weights for the minimum error. In this research, the real frequency is calculated first using ANSYS program and is defined as a goal function for neural network, so that all outputs of the network can be compared to this function and the error can be calculated. Then, a set of inputs including dimensions or specifications of plate are made using MATLAB program. After the determination of algorithm and quantification of the network, the phases of training and testing of the results are carried out and the output of the network is created. It is concluded that according to results, the performance of the neural network is optimum, and the errors are less than 7%, so the network can perform training in different manner. Furthermore the time of frequency calculations in neural network is less than real analysis time that calculated by ANSYS software, and it's precision is acceptable(less than 10%).

AB  - For the high dimensional and small failure probability events widely existing in engineering, structural reliability analysis method still faces challenges at present. Since active subspace (AS) method can effectively reduce the dimension of input vector space, and metamodel-based importance sampling (IS) can efficiently estimate small failure probability, this paper combines AS with IS to propose an adaptive two-stage Kriging model method (ASIS-AK2) for rare failure event with high dimensional problem. The proposed AS-IS-AK2 includes two stages. In the first stage, a new learning function is proposed to construct the Kriging model for roughly estimating the performance function values of all IS samples, and the gradient information is provided as a by-product for AS. In the second stage, an adaptive Kriging method is constructed in the reduced dimension space to accurately judge the states of all IS samples. Since AS reduces the dimension of input vector space, and IS reduces the required size of candidate sample pool for obtaining the convergent failure probability estimation, the computational complexity is reduced in reconstructing the Kriging model to judge the states of IS samples. The results of three examples verify the advantage of the proposed method for high dimensional problem with small failure probability.

AB  - Many engineering systems involve complex implicit performance functions, and evaluating the failure probability of these systems usually requires time-consuming finite element simulations. In this research, a new reliability method is proposed by combining relevance vector machine and Markov-chain-based importance sampling (RVM-MIS), which improves computational efficiency by decreasing the number of expensive model simulations. Relevance vector machine (RVM) is a machine learning method based on the concept of probabilistic Bayesian learning framework. It is worth noting that RVM provides predicted value of the sample and corresponding variance. Due to this important feature, various active learning functions can be applied to improve the accuracy of RVM to approximate real performance functions. In addition, Markov-chain-based importance sampling (MIS) is utilized to generate important samples covering areas that significantly contribute to failure probability. The important samples are then predicted by a well-constructed RVM to obtain failure probability, rather than being evaluated using real performance functions, so the computation time is drastically decreased. RVM-MIS reduces the number of calls to real performance function while ensuring the accuracy of results. Four academic examples and a bearing statics problem with an implicit performance function are performed to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.

AB  - A recent study I showed that different attention cues (social and non-social) produce qualitatively different learning effects. The mechanisms underlying such differences, however, were unclear. Here, we present a novel computational model of audio-visual learning combining two competing processes: habituation and association. The model's parameters were trained to best reproduce each infant's individual looking behavior from trial-to-trial in training and testing. We then isolated each infant's learning function to explain the variance found in preferential looking tests. The model allowed us to rigorously examine the relationship between the infants' looking behavior and their learning mechanisms. By condition, the model revealed that 8-month-olds learned faster from the social (i.e. face) than the non-social cue (i.e., flashing squares), as evidenced by the parameters of their learning functions. In general, the 4-month-olds learned more slowly than the 8-month-olds. The parameters for attention to the cue revealed that infants at both ages who weighted the social cue highly learned quickly. With non-social cues, 8-month-olds were impaired in learning, as the cue competed for attention with the target visual event Using explicit models to link looking and learning, we can draw firm conclusions about infants' cognitive development from eye-movement behavior.

AB  - The performance of complex engineering systems often changes over time and space, potentially leading to multiple failure modes. Such time and space variance presents a challenge to reliability analysis and design methods. To address this issue, this paper first analyzes three categories of approaches to four types of time-variant reliability problems, and then develops an adaptive uniform design-based Kriging (AUDK) framework with an improved weighted sampling method (IWSM), termed the AUDK-IWSM. In particular, a Kriging response surface of the extreme function for time and space-variant limit states is constructed, and then an existing weighted sampling method is improved for high precision to prepare the sampling points for reliability analysis on the Kriging surface. To construct the AUDK model and update it with the most probable point, an adaptive iterative algorithm is developed based on the IWSM. Thus, through integrating the reliability index of the generated Kriging response surface, the resultant AUDKIWSM algorithm improves reliability calculations and enhances computational efficiency of the reliability analysis. The AUDK-IWSM is illustrated, and its effectiveness is verified through four case studies for engineering practice, in comparison with a number of state-of-the-art techniques reported in the literature.

AB  - It remains a great challenge to investigate time-variant reliability-based design optimization (TRBDO) problems, owing to the high computational cost of time-variant reliability analysis, and the difficulties in modeling. To address these issues, PSO-t-IRS, a methodology incorporating a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and an enhanced instantaneous response surface (t-IRS), is proposed. First, the enhanced t-IRS method is developed to construct the extended instantaneous response surrogate model. It is worth noting that, different from the original t-IRS method, the design variables are added to the input parameters in constructing the surrogate model. When generating Monte Carlo samples for reliability calculation, the design variables and the time parameter are treated as uniformly distributed random variables. The extended surrogate model construction is the key factor for solving the TRBDO. Once the model is built, time-variant reliability can be computed conveniently, and the solution of TRBDO is readily found by using any efficient optimization algorithm. In this work, the extended surrogate model is integrated into the PSO algorithm, leading to the proposed method, PSO-t-IRS. The effectiveness of the PSO-t-IRS method is demonstrated with two TRBDO examples. Thereinafter, the proposed method is applied to four system TRBDO examples featuring series, parallel, compound systems and a 23-bar truss problem.

AB  - Accurate prediction of rainfall is extremely important to design of hydrological system and water resources management. In this study, two different techniques, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and Learning-Cellular Automation (CLA) were used to classify rainy days. A wide range of dataset (2249 dataset) was collected from Shiraz synoptic stations including temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and daily rainfall. The results indicated that the CLA with R-2=0.796 and RMSE=0.431 provides better classification in comparison with ANN (R-2=0.566 and RMSE=0.407). Then, daily rainfall is predicted using a novel hybrid method of ANN and CLA (ANN-CLA) that has the ability to automatically remove non-rainy days. To investigate the performance of proposed method, the results of ANN-CLA were compared with one of the most common neural network method, namely Feed Forward Back Propagation (FFBP) with two learning function of LM (FFBP-LM) and BFGS (FFBP-BFGS). The result indicated that hybrid of ANN-CLA successfully predicts daily rainfall (R-2=0.881 and RMSE=0.202) in comparison with FFBP-LM (R-2=0.839 and RMSE=0.222) and FFBP-BFGS (R-2=0.698 and RMSE=0.246). A sensitivity analysis is performed on the data to determine the effect of input parameters on the daily rainfall. This analysis indicates that the average wind speed is the main parameter for prediction of rainfall. This research highlights that the presented techniques can be successfully employed as a robust method for prediction of problems related to water resources, hydrology, and water sciences.

AB  - Active learning methods have recently surged in the literature due to their ability to solve complex structural reliability problems within an affordable computational cost. These methods are designed by adaptively build-ing an inexpensive surrogate of the original limit-state function. Examples of such surrogates include Gaussian process models which have been adopted in many contributions, the most popular ones being the efficient global reliability analysis (EGRA) and the active Kriging Monte Carlo simulation (AK-MCS), two milestone contributions in the field. In this paper, we first conduct a survey of the recent literature, showing that most of the proposed methods actually span from modifying one or more aspects of the two aforementioned methods. We then propose a generalized modular framework to build on-the-fly efficient active learning strategies by combining the following four ingredients or modules: surrogate model, reliability estimation algorithm, learning function and stopping criterion. Using this framework, we devise 39 strategies for the solution of 20 reliability benchmark problems. The results of this extensive benchmark (more than 12,000 reliability problems solved) are analyzed under various criteria leading to a synthesized set of recommendations for practitioners. These may be refined with a priori knowledge about the feature of the problem to solve, i.e. dimensionality and magnitude of the failure probability. This benchmark has eventually highlighted the importance of using surrogates in conjunction with sophisticated reliability estimation algorithms as a way to enhance the efficiency of the latter.

AB  - Introduction Programmatic assessment was introduced as an approach to design assessment programmes with the aim to simultaneously optimize the decision-making and learning function of assessment. An integrative review was conducted to review and synthesize results from studies investigating programmatic assessment in health care professions education in practice. Methods The authors systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, and ERIC to identify studies published since 2005 that reported empirical data on programmatic assessment. Characteristics of the included studies were extracted and synthesized, using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Results Twenty-seven studies were included, which used quantitative methods (n= 10), qualitative methods (n= 12) or mixed methods (n= 5). Most studies were conducted in clinical settings (77.8%). Programmatic assessment was found to enable meaningful triangulation for robust decision-making and used as a catalyst for learning. However, several problems were identified, including overload in assessment information and the associated workload, counterproductive impact of using strict requirements and summative signals, lack of a shared understanding of the nature and purpose of programmatic assessment, and lack of supportive interpersonal relationships. Thematic analysis revealed that the success and challenges of programmatic assessment were best understood by the interplay between quantity and quality of assessment information, and the influence of social and personal aspects on assessment perceptions. Conclusion Although some of the evidence may seem compelling to support the effectiveness of programmatic assessment in practice, tensions will emerge when simultaneously stimulating the development of competencies and assessing its result. The identified factors and inferred strategies provide guidance for navigating these tensions.

KW  - MAXIMUM-ENTROPY APPROACH
AB  - In currently popular access control models, the security policies and regulations never change in the running system process once they are identified, which makes it possible for attackers to find the vulnerabilities in a system, resulting in the lack of ability to perceive the system security status and risks in a dynamic manner and exposing the system to such risks. By introducing the maximum entropy (MaxENT) models into the rule optimization for the Bell-LaPadula (BLP) model, this paper proposes an improved BLP model with the self-learning function: MaxENT-BLP. This model first formalizes the security properties, system states, transformational rules, and a constraint model based on the states transition of the MaxENT. After handling the historical system access logs as the original data sets, this model extracts the user requests, current states, and decisions to act as the feature vectors. Second, we use k-fold cross validation to divide all vectors into a training set and a testing set. In this paper, the model training process is based on the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. And this model contains a strategy update algorithm to adjust the access control rules dynamically according to the access and decision records in a system. Third, we prove that MaxENT-BLP is secure through theoretical analysis. By estimating the precision, recall, and F1-score, the experiments show the availability and accuracy of this model. Finally, this paper provides the process of model training based on deep learning and discussions regarding adversarial samples from the malware classifiers. We demonstrate that MaxENT-BLP is an appropriate choice and has the ability to help running information systems to avoid more risks and losses.

AB  - Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a method that teaches agents to make informed decisions in diverse environments through trial and error, aiming to maximize a reward function and discover the optimal Q-learning function for decision-making. In this study, we apply RL to a rule-based water management simulation, utilizing a deep learning approach for the Q-learning value function. The trained RL model can learn from the environment and make real-time decisions. Our approach offers an unbiased method for analyzing complex watershed scenarios, providing a reward function as an analytical metric while optimizing decision-making time. Overall, this work underscores RL's potential in addressing complex problems, demanding exploration, sequential decision-making, and continuous learning. External variables such as policy shifts, which are not readily integrated into the model, can substantially influence outcomes. Upon establishing a model with the requisite minimal states and actions, the subsequent learning process is relatively straightforward, depending on the selection of appropriate RL model algorithms. Its application depends on the specific problem. The primary challenge in this modeling approach lies in model definition, specifically in devising agents and actions that apply to complex scenarios. Our specific example was designed to address recent decision-making challenges related to constructing dams due to water scarcity. We present two examples: one from a nationwide perspective in Mexico and the other focused on Baja California Sur, the state with the highest water stress. Our results demonstrate our capability to prioritize watersheds effectively for the most significant benefits, particularly dam construction.

AB  - Adaptive reliability analysis methods based on surrogate models, especially kriging, have been successfully implemented in many problems. However, the application of kriging is limited to low-dimensional problems with noncategorical performance data. Support vector machine (SVM), by contrast, addresses these limitations, but its application in reliability analysis faces several challenges with regard to robustness, accuracy, and efficiency. This study proposed a new adaptive approach based on probabilistic support vector machine for reliability analysis (PSVM-RA). Different from existing methods that only select training points in the margin of the SVM, the proposed method adopts a new learning function that considers the wrong classification probability for each realization and maximizes the potential for new information offered by a candidate sample for the training set. Moreover, the upper bound of the error that is introduced by the SVM in estimating the failure probability is derived based on a Poisson binomial distribution model considering the likelihood of wrong classification for all the points in the margin of the SVM. This upper bound of error was used in the proposed framework as a stopping criterion to guarantee the desired accuracy. Three numerical examples and an engineering application regarding the wind-reliability analysis of transmission towers were investigated to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. It was demonstrated that PSVM-RA can provide robust estimates of failure probability when other state-of-the-art methods fail. Moreover, it offers a balance between efficiency and accuracy.

AB  - In licensed-assisted access using the LTE (LAA) standard, carrier sensing via the listen before-talk (LBT) procedure is a vital feature for fair sharing with the Wi-Fi systems. Furthermore, it has been designed to support frequency reuse-1 operation among all cells by the virtue of licensed spectrum. As opposed to the two existing channel-access schemes for frequency reuse-1, transmission start time alignment (TSTA) and energy detection threshold adaptation (EDTA), which may not be able to maximize the LAA system throughput without violating the requirement of fair coexistence, we propose a new frequency-reuse-1 scheme, referred to as the alignment reference interval adaptation-based LAA (ARIALAA). It attempts to combine the advantages of TSTA and EDTA into a unified access framework, in which the alignment reference interval (ARI) is adaptively adjusted to control the channel-access probability for LAA and Wi-Fi systems. Meanwhile, to operate the ARIA-LAA effectively toward our design objective, we design the fuzzy Q-learning system that adapts the continuous variable ARI to the dynamically changing wireless network environment. Based on the analytical system models and formation of the optimization problem, it employs a model-free learning algorithm that interacts with the state, defined as the current level of fairness achieved by adaptation, and the Q-learning function to determine the ARI as a global action. Our simulation results demonstrate that the ARIA-LAA is a novel scheme of spectrum sharing with spatial reuse for LAA that enhances the overall system capacity while satisfying the fair-coexistence requirement in the unlicensed spectrum.

AB  - As the proportion of power electronics-related facilities in modern power systems increases, the types of power quality disturbances (PQDs) tend to become more complex. Traditional methods struggle to accurately perform the classification task of complex PQDs under artificial empirical guidance. This article proposes a multidimensional feature-driven ensemble model for the accurate classification of complex PQDs, which can complete the self-learning function from data. Unlike existing deep learning-based methods, this model considers both spatial features in the time-frequency domain and temporal relational features. Based on fully convolutional networks (FCNs) and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU), submodules suitable for multidimensional features mining are constructed separately. Meanwhile, the squeeze-and-excitation network (SENet) is introduced to complete the computation of the channel attention mechanism for each convolutional layer, which effectively improves the training efficiency and classification accuracy of the model. The proposed model has been thoroughly tested to validate its effectiveness on a synthetic dataset consisting of 71 different types of PQDs under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Additionally, the model has been proven to be robust in the face of external factors, such as dc offset, frequency variations, and phase jumps. To further demonstrate its reliability, the proposed model has been tested on real PQDs generated from an ac power source. Results from both simulation and experimentation have conclusively shown that the proposed method is superior to existing deep learning-based methods for the classification of complex PQDs.

AB  - Most of the existing methods for estimating time-dependent failure credibility (TDFC) are based on optimization algorithms, which may result in a heavy burden on the computational cost and accuracy issue related to the local optimization. In order to achieve the best compromise between computational accuracy and cost, an efficient method is proposed in this work by embedding a single-loop adaptive Kriging model (S-AK) into the dichotomy searching algorithm (S-AK-DSA). The proposed S-AK-DSA can be regarded as a double-loop procedure. In the inner loop, the Kriging model of the real time-dependent performance function (TD-PF) is updated iteratively to accurately predict the signs of the upper/lower boundary of the TD-PF minimum with respect to the time variable at the given membership level. Based on the inner loop, the outer loop searches TDFC by continuously dichotomizing the searching interval of the TDFC. The advantages of S-AK-DSA are mainly manifested in two aspects. Firstly, S-AK-DSA converts the problem of optimizing the exact value of the upper/lower boundary into the problem of accurately identifying their signs, which can avoid the use of optimization algorithms. Secondly, at different membership levels, the S-AK-DSA method chooses the candidate sample pool and continuously updates the current Kriging model of TD-PF, and the adaptive learning function as well as appropriate stopping criterion can effectively reduce the cost of predicting the signs of the upper/lower boundary and improve the computational accuracy. Four case studies are introduced to demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed S-AK-DSA approach.

AB  - Time-dependent failure credibility (TDFC) in a given service time of interest can reasonably quantify the safety of the structure with fuzzy inputs. However, the estimation of TDFC requires high computational cost because it involves multi-layer optimization, especially for problems with the implicit performance functions in engineering. In order to improve the efficiency of estimating TDFC under satisfied precision, this paper proposes an efficient dichotomy searching algorithm (DSA) combined with double-loop adaptive Kriging (D-AK) model (shorten as D-AK-DSA). In the proposed D-AK-DSA, a double-loop adaptive Kriging model is constructed to provide the directions for the dichotomy searching TDFC. In the inner loop, the AK model is constructed to surrogate the relation of the performance function and time variable at the given fuzzy input realization so as to obtain the minimum performance function with respect to the time for the outer loop, and in the outer loop, the AK model is constructed to identify the sign of the upper/lower boundary of the minimum performance function with the fuzzy inputs at a given membership interval so as to provide the dichotomy searching direction for TDFC. By the proposed dichotomy searching strategy, accurately solving the values of the upper/lower boundaries in evaluating TDFC is innovatively replaced by identifying the signs of them, which greatly reduces the difficulty of constructing the outer AK model. At the same time, the proposed method enhances the convergence of the outer AK surrogate model by establishing a reasonably improved learning function. Three examples verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed D-AK-DSA method.

AB  - Reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) has been an important research field with the increasing demand for product reliability in practical applications. This paper presents a new RBDO method combining adaptive surrogate model and Importance Sampling-based Modified Sequential Optimization and Reliability Assessment (IS-based modified SORA) method, which aims to reduce the number of calls to the expensive objective function and constraint functions in RBDO. The proposed method consists of three key stages. First, the samples are sequentially selected to construct Kriging models with high classification accuracy for each constraint function. Second, the samples are obtained by Markov Chain Monte Carlo in the safety domain of design space. Then, another Kriging model for the objective function is sequentially constructed by adding suitable samples to update the Design of Experiment (DoE) of the objective function. Third, the expensive objective and constraint functions of the original optimization problem are replaced by the surrogate models. Then, the IS-based modified SORA method is performed to decouple reliability optimization problem into a series of deterministic optimization problems that are solved by a Genetic Algorithm. Several examples are adopted to verify the proposed method. The optimization results show that the proposed method can reduce the number of calls to the original objective function and constraint functions without loss of precision compared to the alternative methods, which illustrates the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.

AB  - To efficiently analyze the time-dependent reliability is still a challenge today for many applications. This paper aims at modifying the original single-loop Kriging surrogate method to make it more efficient especially for assessing the small time-dependent failure probability. The first contribution of the proposed method is that the radial-based importance sampling scheme is nested in the single-loop Kriging surrogate model-based time-dependent reliability analysis method. By the radial-based importance sampling scheme, the optimal hypersphere can be searched and the samples inside the optimal hypersphere can be removed from the candidate sampling pool. Besides, the samples outside the optimal hypersphere are divided into several sub-candidate sampling pools by the in-process hyperspheres. By decreasing the size of candidate sampling pool in each updating process of Kriging model, the training time of updating Kriging model can be reduced so that the efficiency of time-dependent reliability analysis is enhanced. The second contribution of the proposed method is that the Kriging model-based dichotomy is embedded skillfully to efficiently find the hyperspheres layer after layer until the optimal hypersphere is found. The third contribution of the proposed method is that a modified learning function is constructed from selecting the most easily identifiable failure time during the time period of interest to efficiently update the Kriging model in each sub-candidate sampling pool. Finally, the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are verified by three examples.

AB  - Uncertainties are usually modeled by random variables, and the values of distribution parameters are estimated from the collected samples. In practical engineering, point and interval samples are possibly available for the estimation of distribution parameters; then, their values are intervals instead of point values. In view of the fact that all distribution parameters are estimated from the same set of samples, they must be correlated rather than mutually independent. In this study, the correlation among interval distribution parameters is considered and modeled using ellipse models, and the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS)-based reliability method for correlated distribution parameters, denoted as D-MCS, is first proposed. Performance functions are usually implicit functions involving simulation that are expensive-to-evaluate evaluate in real applications; hence, an efficient adaptive surrogate model-based reliability method for structural systems with correlated interval distribution parameters is proposed to reduce computational burden. A new and efficient learning function based on the U function is developed to adaptively add the best new training samples at each iteration. The corresponding stopping criterion to terminate the proposed algorithm is also developed. The lower and upper bounds of probability of failure are calculated based on the final constructed surrogate model. The proposed method is effective because it can provide more accurate reliability results compared with traditional independence assumption reliability methods, and it can be used for structural systems with mixed variables. The proposed method is easy to code and understand. Three numerical examples are investigated to show the applicability of the proposed method.

AB  - Discrete-time min-max finite-horizon model predictive control (FHMPC) generally suffers from low computational efficiency. Its complexity increases exponentially with the control input dimension and the length of the control prediction horizon, and it relies on a known nominal system model. To achieve high-performance computing and a model-free solution, this paper presents a fast model-free equivalent approach for min-max FHMPC via a critic-only Q-learning technique, which can address multi-input multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems. In detail, the proposed approach only uses a series of iterated Q-learning training steps to realize equivalent convex optimization of min-max FHMPC, but with better computational efficiency. A Q-learning function is designed by an online model-free critic-only technique that contains the variables of the system inputs, states and disturbances, and it is robust to real-time interactions with the measured system inputs, states and the known boundness of disturbances. For the problem of the control input constraints of min-max FHMPC, the author integrates them into a part of the critic-only neural network with constrained online optimization. Furthermore, the equivalent characteristic of the proposed approach to min-max FHMPC is proved. The control feasibility and stability of the proposed approach are analyzed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by two simulation examples of MIMO discrete-time systems.

AB  - Self-paced learning (SPL) is a learning mechanism inspired by human and animal learning processes that gives variable weights to samples, gradually introducing simple to more complicated samples into the learning set as the "age" parameter increases. To regulate the learning process, a self-paced weighting regularization term with an "age" parameter is introduced to the learning function. Several self-paced weighting methods have been proposed, and different regularization terms might result in varied learning performance. However, on the one hand, it is difficult to select a suitable weighting method for SPL. On the other hand, it is challenging to determine the "age" parameter, and it is easy for SPL to obtain poor results as the "age" of the model increases. To solve the aforementioned difficulties, an ensemble SPL approach with an adaptive mixture weighting mechanism is proposed in this study. First, as the "age" parameter increases, a set of base classifiers is collected to produce a new data set, which is used to learn the second-level classifier. Then, the ensemble model is used to generate the final output to avoid the selection of the optimal "age" parameter. An adaptive mixture weighting method is designed to reduce the dependence of parameters on human experience. The previous methods find it difficult to determine the "age" parameters or self-paced parameters. In this paper, these parameters can be adjusted adaptively during the learning process. In comparison with the previous SPL techniques, the proposed method achieves the best results in 27 of the 32 datasets in the experiments with the adaptive parameters. The statistical tests are carried out to show that the proposed method is superior to other state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB  - The reliability analysis of structural systems with multiple failure modes and mixed variables is a critical problem because of complex nonlinear correlations among failure modes (or components), huge computational burden of time-consuming implicit functions, and complex failure regions. In this paper, aleatory and epistemic uncertainties are considered simultaneously, and an efficient adaptive kriging-based reliability method is proposed for structural systems with multiple failure modes and mixed variables. Two new learning functions are developed as guidelines for selecting new training samples at each iteration. The proposed learning functions and corresponding stopping criteria are directly linked to system probability of failure; this allows the proposed method to select new training samples efficiently To determine the lower and upper bounds of system probability of failure, the limit-state functions in the entire uncertainty space of interest are accurately constructed while avoiding complicated nested optimizations. The proposed method has the following advantages: (1) the learning functions and stopping criteria are directly linked to system probability of failure, and the structure importance of components is also considered; (2) it requires fewer samples to achieve accurate results, and can be applied to small system probability of failure; (3) it is easy to use for extremely complex systems (e.g., bridge systems); (4) it can be applied to a system with multiple failure modes and mixed variables (e.g., mixture of random and p-box variables). The capabilities and efficiency of the proposed method are validated through four numerical examples; results show that it has high applicability and accuracy. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Venue recommendation has attracted a lot of research attention with the rapid development of Location Based Social Networks. The effectiveness of venue recommendation largely depends on how well it captures users' contexts or preferences. However, it is quite difficult, if not impossible, to capture the whole information about users' preferences. In addition, users' preferences are often heterogeneous (i.e., some preferences are static and common to all users while some preferences are dynamic and diverse). Existing venue recommendation does not well address the aforementioned issues and often recommends the most popular, the cheapest, or the closest venues based on simple contexts.
   In this paper, we cast the venue recommendation as a ranking problem and propose a recommendation framework named VRer (Context-Based Venue Recommendation using embedded space ranking SVM) employing an embedded space ranking SVM model to separate the venues in terms of different characteristics. Our proposed approach makes use of 'check-in' data to capture users' preferences and utilizes a machine learning model to tune the importance of different factors in ranking. The major contribution of this paper are: (1) VRer combines various contexts (e.g., the temporal influence and the category of locations) with the check-in records to capture individual heterogeneous preferences; (2) we propose an embedded space ranking SVM optimizing the learning function to reduce the time consumption of training the personalized recommendation model for each group or user; (3) we evaluate our proposed approach against a real world LBSN and compare it with other baseline methods. Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - African leaves (Vernonia amygdalina Del.) is a nutrient-rich plant that has been widely used as a herbal plant. African leaves contain chlorophyll which identify compounds produced by a plant, such as flavonoids and phenols. Chlorophyll testing can be carried out nondestructively by using the SPAD 502 chlorophyll meter. However, it is quite expensive, so that another non-destructive method is developed, namely digital image analysis. Relationships between chlorophyll content and leaf image colour indices in the RGB, HSV, HSL, and Lab* space are examined. The objectives of this study are 1) to analyse the relationship between texture parameters of red, green, blue, grey, hue, saturation(HSL), lightness (HSL), saturation( HSV), value(HSV), L*, a*, and b* against the chlorophyll content in African leaves using a flatbed scanner (HP DeskJet 2130 Series); and 2) built a model to predict chlorophyll content in African leaves using optimised ANN through a feature selection process by using several filter methods. The best ANN topologies are 10-30-40-1 (10 input nodes, 40 nodes in hidden layer 1, 30 nodes in hidden layer 2, and 1 output node) with a trainlm on the learning function, tansig on the hidden layer, and purelin on the output layer. The selected topology produces MSE training of 0.0007 with R training 0.9981 and the lowest validation MSE of 0.012 with R validation of 0.967. With these results, it can be concluded that the ANN model can be potentially used as a model for predicting chlorophyll content in African leaves.

AB  - The application of reliability analysis and reliability sensitivity analysis methods to complicated structures faces two main challenges: small failure probability (typical less than 10(-5)) and time-demanding mechanical models. This paper proposes an improved active learning surrogate model method, which combines the advantages of the classical Active Kriging - Monte Carlo Simulation (AK-MCS) procedure and the Adaptive Linked Importance Sampling (ALIS) procedure. The proposed procedure can, on the one hand, adaptively produce a series of intermediate sampling density approaching the quasi-optimal Importance Sampling (IS) density, on the other hand, adaptively generate a set of intermediate surrogate models approaching the true failure surface of the rare failure event. Then, the small failure probability and the corresponding reliability sensitivity indices are efficiently estimated by their IS estimators based on the quasi-optimal IS density and the surrogate models. Compared with the classical AK-MCS and Active Kriging - Importance Sampling (AK-IS) procedure, the proposed method neither need to build very large sample pool even when the failure probability is extremely small, nor need to estimate the Most Probable Points (MPPs), thus it is computationally more efficient and more applicable especially for problems with multiple MPPs. The effectiveness and engineering applicability of the proposed method are demonstrated by one numerical test example and two engineering applications.

AB  - Evidence has demonstrated that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) contribute to the pathophysiology of bacterial meningitis; therefore, MMP inhibitors may be a neuroprotective treatment for brain injury caused by meningitis because of their anti-inflammatory effects. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the MMP inhibitor GM6001 in a rat model of S. pneumoniae meningitis. For these experiments, 7-day-old Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into an uninfected group, meningitis group, antibiotic group and GM6001+antibiotic group. Uninfected animals were sham infected with sterile saline. Rats in the other three groups were inoculated with S. pneumoniae and left untreated, treated with ceftriaxone, or treated with ceftriaxone combined with GM6001. Rats in the meningitis group were severely ill, and MMP-9 was significantly up-regulated. The change in brain water content was consistent with the MMP-9 level. A significant loss of neurons and impaired learning function were observed in the meningitis group. Treatment with the antibiotic and GM6001 significantly down-regulated the level of MM1P-9, decreased the brain water content, attenuated neuronal injury and improved learning. Conclusions: GM6001 protected the brain from damage caused by S. pneumoniae, and this effect may occur via downregulating MMP-9 and decreasing brain water content.

AB  - With increasing intermittent and fluctuant wind power integrated into the power system, the high penetration of wind generation has brought a series of challenges including voltage stability for the safe operation of power system. Static VAR Compensator (SVC) has been widely used to control the voltage on the point of common coupling (PCC) of wind farm. When severe fault occurs and leads to serious voltage drop in the system, SVC controlled by the conventional control method may cause voltage overshoot after the fault clearance due to its response time lag. And this voltage overshoot of PCC may lead to the failure of high voltage ride through. In order to solve such a problem and improve the system voltage stability under severe fault conditions, a goal representation adaptive dynamic programming (GrADP) based SVC controller is proposed in this paper. The proposed control method can precisely control reactive output of SVC through its self-learning function to approximate the optimal control policy. Thus the voltage on the PCC is effectively controlled. An IEEE four-machine two-area system is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Detailed simulation analysis and comparative studies with particle swarm optimization (PSO) optimized SVC controller are carried out to demonstrate the performance of the new method. Simulation results indicate that the proposed control strategy is effective in mitigating the voltage overshoot with good adaptability under various operating conditions.

AB  - Calculation of the stress intensity factor K is a crucial and difficult task in linear elastic fracture mechanics. With the capacity to solve complex input-output problems of an underlying system, machine learning is especially useful in the calculation of K. However, when faced with complex systems, such as the firtree groove structure of a turbine disk, the data-consuming issue has always been a thorny problem in K -solutions combined with machine learning studies for a long time. In this paper, a novel K -solution method called PA-GPR (Pool -based Active learning with Gaussian Process Regression) for the calculation of the stress intensity factor for surface cracks in the firtree groove structure of a turbine disk is proposed. Using the pool -based active learning strategy, the proposed K -solution method could make the GPR model have a great regression performance with a few samples required. In the pool -based active learning strategy analysis, the learning function based on greedy sampling is proposed to select samples with a high contribution to the training of the GPR model. The calculation of K for a semi -elliptical surface crack in the firtree groove structure is evaluated to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that this novel method is accurate, time -saving and effective.

AB  - The learning quality of humans depends on the sense of contemplation. Textual documents are a huge part of the literature on contemplation which effortlessly creates perception. Automatic document class identification or organisation is a machine learning function to understand the psychological and emotional content of the text in a concise way. The problem of identification of documents falls in the field of library science, information science and artificial intelligence. The research progress of class identification of documents has been made in various most spoken languages. Numerous research works have been published in European and Asian languages. However, there is a gap in the literature when it comes to any less resource language, especially Bengali. Consequently, this work portrays an efficient topic modelling approach for Bengali document class identification. It proposes a Dirichlet-polynomial clustering model likelihood corpus distribution (LCD), which is based on a Bayesian numerical prototype. Experiments are done to prove the efficiency of LCD over various topic modelling algorithms, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), LDA with bag-of-words (LDA-BOW), latent semantic indexing (LSI), and hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP). For performance evaluation, we considered five real-world datasets of Bengali corpora, such as science, sports, computer, season, and epic in this work. The coherence score of different modelling algorithms is compared to find the best model for each dataset separately.

AB  - Dynamic networks are popularly used to describe networks that change with time. Although there have been a large number of research works on understanding dynamic networks using link prediction, node classification and community detection, there is rare work that is specially designed to address the challenge of big network size of dynamic networks. To this end, we study in this paper an emerging and challenging problem of network coarsening in dynamic networks. Network coarsening refers to a class of network "zoom-out" operations where node pairs and edges are grouped together for efficient analysis on big networks. However, existing network coarsening approaches can only handle static networks where network structure weights have been predefined before the coarsening calculation. Under the observation that big networks are highly dynamic and naturally change over time, we consider in this paper to embed information diffusion data which reflect the dynamics of networks for network coarsening. Specifically, we present a new Semi-NetCoarsen approach that jointly maximizes the likelihood of observing the information diffusion data and minimizes the network regularization with respect to the predefined network structural data. The learning function is convex and we use the accelerated proximal gradient algorithm to obtain the global optimal solution. We conduct experiments on two synthetic and five real-world data sets to validate the performance of the proposed method. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurological disorder affecting memory function in elderly persons. Indeed, AD exhibits abnormality in cognitive behaviors and higher susceptibility to neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). Various factors including aging, sex difference and NPS severity, are implicated during in development of AD. In this study, we evaluated behavioral abnormalities of AD model, PDAPP transgenic mice at young age using the Morris Water Maze test, which was established to assess hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. We found that female AD model mice exhibited spatial learning dysfunction and highly susceptible to NPS such as anxiety and depression, whereas spatial reference memory function was comparable in female PDAPP Tg mice to female wild type (WT) mice. Spatial learning function was comparable in male AD model mice to male WT mice. Multiple regression analysis showed that spatial learning dysfunction was associated with NPS severity such as anxiety and depression. Furthermore, the analysis showed that spatial reference memory function was associated with status of depression, but not anxiety. Thus, these results suggest female dominance of spatial learning dysfunction in the AD model mice accompanying increased NPS severity. The understandings of AD model may be useful for the development of therapeutic agents and methods in human AD.

AB  - Elderly patients with dementia suffer from cognitive dysfunctions and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) such as anxiety and depression. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a form of age-related dementia, and loss of cholinergic neurons is intimately associated with development of AD symptoms. We and others have reported that neural cell transplantation ameliorated cognitive dysfunction in AD model mice. It remains largely unclear whether neural cell transplantation ameliorates the NPS of AD. It would be interesting to determine whether NPS correlates with cognitive dysfunctions before and after neural cell transplantation in AD model mice. Based on the revalidation of our previous data from a Morris water maze test, we found that neural cell transplantation improved anxiety and depression significantly and marginally affected locomotion activity in AD mice. A correlation analysis revealed that the spatial learning function of AD mice was correlated with their NPS scores both before and after cell transplantation in a similar manner. In contrast, in the mice subjected to cell transplantation, spatial reference memory function was not correlated with NPS scores. These results suggested the neural cell transplantation in the AD model mice significantly improved NPS to the same degree as cognitive dysfunctions, possibly via distinct mechanisms, such as the cholinergic and GABAergic systems.

AB  - Using a threat conditioning task, this study shows that the subjective experience of pain and associated physiological responses are related to prediction errors.
   Pain perception and its modulation are fundamental to human learning and adaptive behavior. This study investigated the hypothesis that pain perception is tied to pain's learning function. Thirty-one participants performed a threat conditioning task where certain cues were associated with a possibility of receiving a painful electric shock. The cues that signaled potential pain or safety were regularly changed, requiring participants to continually establish new associations. Using computational models, we quantified participants' pain expectations and prediction errors throughout the task and assessed their relationship with pain perception and electrophysiological responses. Our findings suggest that subjective pain perception increases with prediction error, that is, when pain was unexpected. Prediction errors were also related to physiological nociceptive responses, including the amplitude of nociceptive flexion reflex and electroencephalography markers of cortical nociceptive processing (N1-P2-evoked potential and gamma-band power). In addition, higher pain expectations were related to increased late event-related potential responses and alpha/beta decreases in amplitude during cue presentation. These results further strengthen the idea of a crucial link between pain and learning and suggest that understanding the influence of learning mechanisms in pain modulation could help us understand when and why pain perception is modulated in health and disease.

AB  - Recently, the active learning Kriging (ALK) metamodel has proved to be an efficient method for structural system reliability analysis with multiple failure modes. A key step for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of an ALK method is to select training samples around the limit state of the performance function as fast as possible. This study develops a new ALK metamodel based on the concept of significant domain where samples contribute the most to the failure of the system, which is termed as the ALK-SD, to achieve the above purpose. First, multiple Kriging models are established based on several initial training samples for each component using a modified DACE toolbox. Then, the significant domain of an engineering system is identified according to the type of the system. Thereafter, a new learning function H is defined to sequentially update the initial Kriging models by selecting the most probable points in the significant domain. Finally, four numerical examples and one engi-neering example are studied to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the corresponding results are subsequently compared with those obtained via similar methods in literature in terms of the computational efficiency and the locations of newly added training samples. The results show that the proposed method can effectively and accurately evaluate the structural system reliability by outperforming its counterparts.

AB  - The probabilistic design of offshore wind turbines aims to ensure structural safety in a cost-effective way. This involves conducting structural reliability assessments for different design options and considering different structural responses. There are several structural reliability methods, and this paper will apply and compare different approaches in some simplified case studies. In particular, the well known environmental contour method will be compared to a more novel approach based on sequential sampling and Gaussian processes regression for an ultimate limit state case study on the maximum flapwise blade root bending moment. For one of the case studies, results will also be compared to results from a brute force simulation approach. Interestingly, the comparison is very different from the two case studies. In one of the cases the environmental contours method agrees well with the sequential sampling method but in the other, results vary considerably. Probably, this can be explained by the violation of some of the assumptions associated with the environmental contour approach, i.e. that the short-term variability of the response is large compared to the long-term variability of the environmental conditions. Results from this simple comparison study suggests that the sequential sampling method can be a robust and computationally effective approach for structural reliability assessment.

AB  - A model-free data-driven Q-learning-based distributed control is proposed for achieving autonomous voltage restoration in isolated AC microgrids (MGs) subject to input saturation. First, by defining the control objective in terms of local neighborhood tracking errors, the voltage restoration problem can be solved by the distributed pinning-based consensus problem. To address the effect of input signal saturation in each distributed generator (DG), the low gain feedback method is considered to obtain these feedback gains. Since these feedback gain matrices are obtained by solving the modified algebraic Riccati equation (MARE) which needs the complete knowledge of DG dynamics, an iterative model-free data-driven Q-learning algorithm is presented. A Q-learning function and a Q-learning Bellman equation are defined for finding these feedback gain matrices. Finally, based on recursive least square techniques, an iterative Q-learning algorithm is proposed for achieving autonomous voltage restoration. To validate the performance of the proposed method, simulations of two isolated AC MG are performed. Simulation results demonstrate that the acquired feedback gains closely align with these analytical solutions of the MARE. Furthermore, the proposed model-free distributed Q-learning method remains its effectiveness even under model uncertainty and plug-and-play operations of DGs.

AB  - As the performance function of a mechanical structure is usually based on time-consuming computer codes, predicting time-dependent reliability analysis requires a large number of costly simulations in engineering. To reduce the number of evaluations of time-consuming models and enhance efficiency of time-dependent reliability analysis, Kriging is employed as a surrogate of original performance function. Firstly, a quantitative measure of the error of Kriging-based estimation of time-dependent failure probability is obtained by derivation. Dividing the quantitative measure by the Kriging-based estimation, the associated relative error is approximately estimated. Secondly, to construct an accurate Kriging model using fewer samples, a DoE (the design of experiments) strategy is developed. The idea is to adaptively refresh Kriging model with the best next sample that could enhance Kriging model the most with regard to expectation. Finally, a Kriging-based time-dependent reliability analysis method is constructed. In the method, Kriging model is adaptively refreshed according to the proposed DoE strategy, until the relative error of estimated probability of failure below a given threshold. The threshold could be quantitatively adjusted to accuracy requirement of reliability analysis. The proposed method can predict the evolution of failure probability over time. Its advantage is validated by three numerical examples.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in learning and memory dysfunction. Cognitive deficits result from cellular and metabolic dysfunction after injury, including decreased cerebral glucose uptake and inflammation. This study assessed the ability of intranasal insulin to increase cerebral glucose uptake after injury, reduce lesion volume, improve memory and learning function and reduce inflammation. Adult male rats received a controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury followed by intranasal insulin or saline treatment daily for 14 days. PET imaging of [F-18]-FDG uptake was performed at baseline and at 48 h and 10 days post-injury and MRI on days three and nine post injury. Motor function was tested with the beam walking test. Memory function was assessed with Morris water maze. Intranasal insulin after CCI significantly improved several outcomes compared to saline. Insulin-treated animals performed better on beam walk and demonstrated significantly improved memory. A significant increase in [F-18]-FDG uptake was observed in the hippocampus. Intranasal insulin also resulted in a significant decrease in hippocampus lesion volume and significantly less microglial immunolabeling in the hippocampus. These data show that intranasal insulin improves memory, increases cerebral glucose uptake and decreases neuroinflammation and hippocampal lesion volume, and may therefore be a viable therapy for TBI.

AB  - The multi-output structural system with implicit function widely exists in actual engineering, which refers that the multiple output responses of structural system can be obtained by one experiment or finite element simulation. Considering the correlation of multiple output responses and the small failure probability involved in multi-output structural system, this article proposes a novel active learning Kriging (ALK) based reliability method for multi-output structural system by combining multiple response Gaussian process (MRGP) and importance sampling (IS). First, due to the Kriging model can only construct the surrogate model under the single-output variable, the MRGP model is introduced to substitute the Kriging model and thus the correlation in multiple output responses can be efficiently described by a correlation matrix in MRGP model. Second, for the case that the distance information of new iterated sample point is not considered by the commonly used learning functions (U-function, EFF-function and H-function) in ALK, three improved learning functions are correspondingly proposed. Finally, aiming at the problem that the small failure probability leads to the increasing of candidate sample pool and further results in low computational efficiency, the IS method is combined with the MRGP model to efficiently accomplish the reliability analysis for multi-output structural system. Several examples are also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - An innovative strategy of the design of experiments (DoE) is proposed to reduce the number of calls of the performance function in the kriging-based structural reliability analysis procedure. Benefitting from the local uncertainty provided by the kriging model and the joint probability density function of performance function values of untried points derived in this research, the epistemic variance of the target failure probability is calculated approximately. The variance is treated as the accuracy measurement of the estimated failure probability. The next best point is defined as the untried point that can minimize the variance of failure probability in the sense of expectation which is computed by Gauss-Hermite quadrature. The basic idea of the proposed strategy is to refresh the current DoE by adding the next best point into it. The candidate points of the next best one are randomly generated by Markov chain Monte Carlo method from the kriging-based conditional distribution. A structural reliability analysis procedure is introduced to apply the proposed DoE strategy, whose stopping criterion is constructed mainly on the basis of the coefficient of variation of failure probability. To validate the efficiency of the proposed DoE strategy, three examples are analyzed in which there are explict and implict performance function. And, the analysis results demonstrate the outperformance of the innovative strategy.

AB  - The self-organizing map (SOM) represents high-dimensional input samples by a 2-dimensional output topological structure, whereby similar input samples are mapped onto the same output unit or neighboring units on a map for visualization. Although many extended SOM models have been proposed, the need to determine a grid structure of SOM before learning, and the lack of adaptability to rapid changes in input data have not yet been fully overcome. This research proposes an adaptive growing grid (AGG) model, which is a novel neural self-organizing map (SOM), for projecting high-dimensional input samples onto an output grid. Due to the need for a grid structure for visualization, the AGG uses both growing and pruning functions and an adaptive learning process in order to adapt its output grid structure and learning function to constantly and rapidly changing input data in a non-stationary environment. The proposed AGG is tested on four basic data sets and one cross-domain data set. In addition, the t-test is used to test whether the proposed AGG outperforms the benchmark model, the growing grid (GG). Based on three evaluation measures, i.e. average quantization error (AQE), topographic error (TE) and dead unit ratio (DUR), the AGG significantly outperforms the GG in a non-stationary environment.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The availability of massive RGB-depth (RGB-D) images poses a compelling need for effective RGB-D content understanding techniques. RGB-D images provide synchronized information from multiple views (e.g., color and depth) of real-world objects and scenes. This work proposes learning compact and discriminative features from the multiple views of RGB-D content toward effective feature representation for RGB-D image understanding. In particular, a robust multiview feature learning approach is developed, which exploits the intrinsic relations among multiple views. The feature learning in multiple views is jointly optimized in an integrated formulation. The joint optimization essentially exploits the intrinsic relations among the views, leading to effective features and making the learning process robust to noises. The feature learning function is formulated as a robust nonnegative graph embedding function over multiple graphs in various views. The graphs characterize the local geometric and discriminating structure of the multiview data. The joint sparsity in l(1)-norm graph embedding and l(21)-norm data factorization further enhances the robustness of feature learning. We derive an efficient computational solution for the proposed approach and provide rigorous theoretical proof with regard to its convergence. We apply the proposed approach to two RGB-D image understanding tasks: RGB-D object classification and RGB-D scene categorization. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world RGB-D image datasets. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - For efficiently estimating the failure probability of the structure with multiple implicit failure domains, a method abbreviated as Meta-IS-AK is proposed by combining the adaptive Kriging Meta model Importance Sampling (Meta-IS) and Importance Sampling based Adaptive Kriging (IS-AK). In the proposed method, the failure probability is equivalently expressed as a product of the augmented failure probability and the correction factor, then two steps are respectively established to solve two terms. In the first step, Meta-IS algorithm is executed to generate IS samples. The augmented failure probability can be estimated as a byproduct in the first step. In the second step, all these IS samples compose a sample pool, in which the AK model is subsequently reconstructed for accurately predicting failure domain indicators instead of the actual implicit limit state function. Then the failure domain indicator at each IS sample and further the correction factor can be efficiently estimated. From the strategy of the proposed method, it can be seen that the proposed Meta-IS-AK possesses both the advantages of the Meta-IS method suitable for multiple failure domains and efficiency of the AK model for accurately predicting the failure domain indicators at all IS samples, which is demonstrated by the numerical and engineering examples.

AB  - Machine learning techniques such as neural networks bear the potential to improve the performance and applicability of model predictive control to real-world systems. However, they also bear the danger of erratic-unpredictable behavior and malfunctioning of machine learning approaches. Neural networks might fail to predict system behavior as it is often impossible to provide strict performance or uncertainty bounds. While this challenge can be tackled using robust model predictive control approaches that span a safety net around the machine learning supported predictions, this can lead to significant performance degradation and infeasibility. To tackle this challenge, a safe neural network-supported learning tube model predictive control scheme is proposed, which allows to bound the worst-case performance in case of a malfunctioning of the machine learning component, yet enables decreasing the conservatism. The basic idea is to enforce the neural network to stay in the vicinity of a presumed given nominal model with the error dynamics directly incorporated into the neural network output function. Therefore, the error dynamics do not require an additional control input, resulting in the omission of input constraint tightening. Constraint fulfillment is guaranteed, robust set stability for a particular learning function class is established, and an upper bound for the performance of a malfunctioning neural network is given. The method is evaluated in simulations considering a rover operating in an uncertain environment.

AB  - Surrogate model-based methods have gradually become a vital method to assess reliability. However, the existing methods usually ignore the memory problems of matching candidate samples with the level of failure probability, which leads to inefficiency and even restricts their applicability. Therefore, this work combining the adaptive Kriging model and sample space partitioning strategy proposes a failure boundary exploration and exploitation framework (FBEEF), which divides the construction process of the adaptive Kriging model into two phases using different candidate samples to enrich training samples. In the exploration phase, a sample space partitioning strategy combining K-means clustering and slice sampling is employed to obtain several subsets and static candidate samples. In the exploitation phase, the approximate distances between the static candidate samples and the failure boundary are calculated to identify important subsets, whose samples are named dynamic candidate samples. Furthermore, a new stopping criterion is developed by combining leave-one-out method and weighted simulation method. To improve the efficiency of FBEEF Monte Carlo simulation or Importance Sampling is selected to estimate the final failure probability. Five examples were analyzed to test the effectiveness of FBEEF, and the results show that FBEEF can obtain good results with fewer training samples and lower analysis time.

AB  - With the development of production technology, the mechanical structure has become more and more complicated, which makes the simulation process of the corresponding computer model very time-consuming. As a result, the reliability analysis needs to consume huge time resources. To deal with this problem, an improved method, which balances the accuracy of failure probability and the efficiency of computation, is proposed. The novelty of the proposed method is the use of an efficient point selection strategy, the k-means algorithm, and the constraint of correlation among the training points. The k-means algorithm can divide the candidate points into a few groups. Therefore, we can update the Kriging model by selecting several sample points which have large contributions to improve the accuracy of failure probability in each iteration. Meanwhile, a constraint is applied to control the relative location among points of DoE to avoid redundant information. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are verified through two numerical examples. Finally, a type of artillery coordination system as a representative of the complex mechanisms is mentioned. And the proposed method is applied to calculate the reliability of the position accuracy of the coordination process, which proves the significance of the proposed method in engineering practice.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to evaluate modelling relationships between pig's body surface temperature and ambient environment including inside and outside of pig barn. For this purpose, four different artificial neural network (ANN), including Feed Forward Back-propagation (FFB), Layer recurrent (LR), Elman (EL) and Cascade Forward Back-propagation (CFB) with different learning algorithms, transfer functions, hidden layers and neuron in each layer, and multi-linear regression (MLR) models have been performed to predict body temperature of pig. Six two-month-old pigs were studied over a period of 92 days during two years (2017-2018) to develop and evaluate the ANN and MLR models. The performance of the models in predicting pig's body temperature was determined using statistical quality parameters, including coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The FFB model with the Levenberg-Marquardt training function, Gradient descent weight and bias learning function, Log-sigmoid transfer function and two hidden layers with 20 neurons was found as the best model. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the temperature-humidity index (THI) inside the room is the most influential factor in predicting pig's body temperature in the MLR/ANN models.

AB  - The purpose of this article was to build an expert system for the development and formulation of push-pull osmotic pump tablets (PPOP). Hundreds of PPOP formulations were studied according to different poorly water-soluble drugs and pharmaceutical acceptable excipients. The knowledge base including database and rule base was built based on the reported results of hundreds of PPOP formulations containing different poorly water-soluble drugs and pharmaceutical excipients and the experiences available from other researchers. The prediction model of release behavior was built using back propagation (BP) neural network, which is good at nonlinear mapping and learning function. Formulation design model was established based on the prediction model of release behavior, which was the nucleus of the inference engine. Finally, the expert system program was constructed by VB.NET associating with SQL Server. Expert system is one of the most popular aspects in artificial intelligence. To date there is no expert system available for the formulation of controlled release dosage forms yet. Moreover, osmotic pump technology (OPT) is gradually getting consummate all over the World. It is meaningful to apply expert system on OPT. Famotidine, a water insoluble drug was chosen as the model drug to validate the applicability of the developed expert system. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - It is generally understood that intractable computational intensity stemming from repeatedly calling performance function when evaluating the contribution of joint focal elements hinders the application of evidence theory in practical engineering. In order to promote the practicability of evidence theory for the reliability evaluation of engineering structures, an efficient reliability analysis method based on the active learning Kriging model is proposed in this study. To start with, a basic variable is selected according to basic probability assignment (BPA) of evidence variables to divide the evidence space into sub-evidence spaces. Intersection points between the performance function and the sub-evidence spaces are then determined by solving the univariate root-finding problem. Sample points are randomly identified to enhance the accuracy of the subsequently established surrogate model. Initial Kriging model with high approximation accuracy is subsequently established through these intersection points and additional sample points generated by Latin hypercube sampling. An active learning function is employed to sequentially refine the Kriging model with minimal sample points. As a result, belief (Bel) measure and plausibility (Pl) measure are derived efficiently via the surrogate model in the evidence-theory-based reliability analysis. The currently proposed analysis method is exemplified with three numerical examples to demonstrate the efficiency and is applied to reliability analysis of positioning accuracy for an industrial robot.

TI  - A LEARNING-THEORETIC CHARACTERISATION OF MARTIN-LoF RANDOMNESS AND SCHNORR RANDOMNESS
T2  - REVIEW OF SYMBOLIC LOGIC
KW  - algorithmic randomness
KW  - formal learning theory
AB  - Numerous learning tasks can be described as the process of extrapolating patterns from observed data. One of the driving intuitions behind the theory of algorithmic randomness is that randomness amounts to the absence of any effectively detectable patterns: it is thus natural to regard randomness as antithetical to inductive learning. Osherson and Weinstein [11] draw upon the identification of randomness with unlearnability to introduce a learning-theoretic framework (in the spirit of formal learning theory) for modelling algorithmic randomness. They define two success criteria-specifying under what conditions a pattern may be said to have been detected by a computable learning function-and prove that the collections of data sequences on which these criteria cannot be satisfied correspond to the set of weak 1-randoms and the set of weak 2-randoms, respectively. This learning-theoretic approach affords an intuitive perspective on algorithmic randomness, and it invites the question of whether restricting attention to learning-theoretic success criteria comes at an expressivity cost. In other words, is the framework expressive enough to capture most core algorithmic randomness notions and, in particular, Martin-Lof randomness-arguably, the most prominent algorithmic randomness notion in the literature? In this article, we answer the latter question in the affirmative by providing a learning-theoretic characterisation of Martin-Lof randomness. We then show that Schnorr randomness, another central algorithmic randomness notion, also admits a learning-theoretic characterisation in this setting.

AB  - The development and distribution of geologically complicated fault structure have the characteristics of uncertainty, randomness, ambiguity, and variability. Therefore, the prediction of complicated fault structures is a typical nonlinear problem. Neither fuzzy logic method nor artificial neural network alone can solve this problem well because the fuzzy method is generally not easy to realize adaptive learning function, and the neural network method is not suitable for describing sedimentary microfacies or geophysical facies. Therefore, taking the marginal subsags in the Jiyang Depression, Eastern China, as a study case, this paper uses the method of combining artificial neural network and fuzzy logic to study geologically complicated fault structure prediction model. This paper expounds on the research status and significance of geologically complicated fault structure prediction model, elaborates the development background, current status, and future challenges of artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic, introduces the method and principle of fuzzy neural network structure and fuzzy logic analysis algorithm, conducts prediction model design and implementation based on fuzzy neural network, proposes the learning algorithm of fuzzy neural network, analyzes the programming realization of fuzzy neural network, constructs complicated fault structure prediction model based on the artificial neural network and fuzzy logic, performs the fuzzy logic system selection of complicated fault structure prediction model, carries out the artificial neural network structure design of complicated fault structure prediction model, compares the prediction effects of the geologically complicated fault structure model based on artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic, and finally discusses the system design and optimization of the prediction model for geologically complicated fault structures. The study results show that the fuzzy neural network fully integrates the advantages of artificial neural network and fuzzy logic system; based on the clear physical background of fuzzy logic system, it effectively integrates powerful knowledge expression ability and fuzzy reasoning ability into the network knowledge structure of neural network, which greatly improves the prediction accuracy of geologically complicated fault structure.

AB  - Natural gas pipeline systems are commonly designed under the assumption of constant supply and demand flow conditions. This is while gas flows are transient because of the compression stations, presence of gas storage facilities and fluctuating supply and consumer demands. Analyzing such transient flows substantially benefits design, control, and monitoring of natural gas pipeline systems. The nonlinear partial differential equations describing the physics of transient flows in pipelines are solved using conventional methods, which are computationally demanding especially for uncertainty quantification purposes where many simulations are required. In this study, we propose an alternative physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for the transient analysis of pipeline networks that can perform transient flow analysis in natural gas pipelines that the original PINNs cannot solve due to the high complexity of the problem. We propose a nested structure for the PINNs with a loss model that greatly reduces the number of tasks in the emergent complex multi-task learning process. We also integrate an adaptive weights approach that tackles the imbalanced gradients caused by the extremely large coefficients in the equations of the natural gas pipeline problem. The proposed framework, for the first time, can produce accurate results for the complex natural gas pipeline network problem using PINNs. Furthermore, we investigate the parameterization of the nested PINNs as a surrogate model for the natural gas pipeline system. With merely 26% more training costs, the surrogate model can perform the transient flow analysis given thousands of realizations of parameters in a split millisecond, while the costs of performing the same simulations using conventional methods can be prohibitively expensive. This can greatly boost the efficiency of complex many-query analyses such as sensitivity analysis, uncertainty propagation and design optimization.

AB  - The classical reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) methods, due to the ever increasing complexity of designs and contingent engineering situations, incur more and more intricate numerical models. The consequent intractable computational intensity has imposed great challenges for practical application of RBDO. Thus, the surrogate-based RBDO methods, and especially those using Kriging model, have received widespread attention recently for their superior computational efficiency without compromise of computational accuracy. On the other hand, the Kriging-based RBDO methods still ensue high computational demands for complex RBDO problems and especially those with implicit objective and constraint functions. To enhance the computational efficiency of the Kriging-based RBDO methods, this study proposes an efficient local adaptive Kriging approximation method with single-loop strategy (LAKAM-SLS), in which Kriging models are employed to replace both the objective and constraint functions. Two different criteria are developed to identify whether Kriging model of performance function in probability constraint is active in each iteration. If the criterion is satisfied, approximate inverse most probable point (IMPP) derived by combining sing-loop approach with Kriging will be used to refine the corresponding Kriging model. For the objective function, its Kriging model is sequentially refined through points selected by a newly proposed learning function from the sample pool generated by taking the optimal solution from each iteration as the sampling center. Four benchmark examples and an application example of head pressure shell are implemented to evaluate the computational performance of the currently proposed LAKAM-SLS against other Kriging-based RBDO methods. The result comparison shows that the currently proposed LAKAM-SLS substantially reduces the computational expense to a relatively low level. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The sulphur content of the desulfurization reactor product is strongly related to the severity of the reaction, which is determined by the reactor bed temperatures. In this study, the potential of neural network and semiempirical regression models to estimate temperature variation in industrial-scale gasoil HDT reactor was examined to achieve improved prediction ability. The reactor consists of 4 beds with 10 temperature indicators to control and monitor the temperature. Model developing Inlet temperature, H2/HC ratio, LCO flowrate, cracked gasoline flowrate, and straight run gasoil flowrate as input layer parameters and bed section outlet temperature as output layer was used. A database with 283 different data was built using daily records of the HDS process from an Iranian refinery. Feedforward backpropagation algorithm with learngdm learning function was used to develop ANN models. The number of neurons in the hidden layer varied between 7-13 to find the most reliable network. The optimum ANN models were selected for reactor temperature profiles on the trial-and-error method. The performance of designed models was tested by computing root mean square error (RMSE), and average absolute deviation (AAD). Comparing the neural network model and regression models, the artificial neural network model is the best model for the reactor bed temperature prediction. The value of AAD for temperatures sensors 1 to 10 in the artificial neural network model obtained 0.128, 0.094, 0.091, 0.1, 0.032, 0.067, 0.052, 0.031, 0.086, and 0.062 respectively, which show good agreement between the actual data and the artificial neural network predicted data for temperature profile in the length of the reactor.

AB  - Offshore steel trestles (OSTs) are exposed to severe marine environments with stochastic wave and current loads, making structural safety assessment challenging and difficult. Reliability analysis is a suitable way to consider both wave and current loading intensity uncertainties, but the implicit and complex limit state functions of the reliability analysis usually imply huge computational costs. This paper proposes an efficient reliability analysis framework for OST using the kriging model of optimal linear unbiased estimation. The surrogate model is built with stochastic waves, current parameters, and the corresponding load factors. The framework is then used to evaluate the reliability of an example OST subjected to wave and current loads at three limit states of OST, including first yield (FY), full plastic (FP), and collapse initiation (CI). Three different distributions are used for comparison of the results of failure probability and reliability index. The results and the computational cost by the proposed framework are compared with that from the Monte Carlo sampling (MCS) and Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) method. The influences of sample number on the prediction accuracy and reliability index are investigated. The influence of marine growth on the reliability analysis of the OST is discussed using MCS and the kriging model. The results show that the reliability analysis based on the kriging model can obtain the reliability index for the OST efficiently with less calculation time but similar results compared with MCS and LHS. With the increase of the number of samples, the prediction accuracy of the kriging model increases, and the corresponding failure probability fluctuates greatly at first and then tends to be stable. The reliability of the example OST is reduced with the increase of marine growth, regardless of the limit state.

AB  - In this paper, the average surface roughness parameter (Ra) is predicted using artificial neural network (ANN) models and internal kernel information and external piezoelectric accelerometer data. Experiments were conducted to Obtain data to develop ANN models to predict surface roughness. A total of 72 samples were used to develop two networks, one based on accelerometer inputs and the other on kernel inputs. The Matlab ANN Toolbox was used for the modeling. The two networks had similar characteristics. Feed-forward back-propagation, 'newff', was the network structure selected, with a Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation training function, 'trainlm', and a backpropagation weight and bias learning function, 'learngdm'. Samples obtained at the experimental stage were randomly divided into three groups to train (70% of the samples), validate (15% of the samples) and test (15% of the samples) the neural networks with a 'dividerand data division function. The input processing functions used were 'fixunknowns', 'removeconstantrows' and 'mapminmax'. The transfer function was 'tansig' for hidden layers and 'purelin' for the output layer. The output processing functions used were 'removeconstantrows' and 'mapminmax'. The inputs consisted of the process parameters of radial depth of cut (Ae), the axial depth of cut (Ap), the spindle speed (N), the feed rate (f), the feed per tooth (fz), the cutting speed (Vc), the tooth passing frequency (ft), the cutting section (Cs), the material removal rate (MRR) and the cutting tool characteristics of the cutter radius (R), the number of teeth (Z) and the tool shape. The main difference between the two neural networks consisted of data origin: one considered data obtained with accelerometers and the other data collected in the NC kernel. Results showing high correlation factors between outputs and targets confirm that data provided by both internal and external sources can be useful for Ra prediction. However, NC kernel data provide several advantages.

AB  - Last-mile operations in forward and reverse logistics are responsible for a large part of the costs, emissions, and times in supply chains. These operations have increased due to the growth of electronic commerce and direct-to-consumer strategies. We propose a novel data- and model-driven framework to support decision making for urban distribution. The methodology is composed of diverse, hybrid, and complementary techniques integrated by a decision support system. This approach focuses on key elements of megacities such as socio-demographic diversity, portfolio mix, logistics fragmentation, high congestion factors, and dense commercial areas. The methodological framework will allow decision makers to create early warning systems and, with the implementation of optimization, machine learning, and simulation models together, make the best utilization of resources. The advantages of the system include flexibility in decision making, social welfare, increased productivity, and reductions in cost and environmental impacts. A real-world illustrative example is presented under conditions in one of the most congested cities: the megacity of Bogota, Colombia. Data come from a retail organization operating in the city. A network of stakeholders is analyzed to understand the complex urban distribution. The execution of the methodology was capable of solving a complex problem reducing the number of vehicles utilized, increasing the resource capacity utilization, and reducing the cost of operations of the fleet, meeting all constraints. These constraints included the window of operations and accomplishing the total number of deliveries. Furthermore, the methodology could accomplish the learning function using deep reinforcement learning in reasonable computational times. This preliminary analysis shows the potential benefits, especially in understudied metropolitan areas from emerging markets, supporting a more effective delivery process, and encouraging proactive, dynamic decision making during the execution stage.

AB  - Reliability assessment of complex structures using simulation methods is time-consuming. Thus, surrogate models are usually employed to reduce computational cost. AK-MCS is a surrogate-based Active learning method combining Kriging and Monte-Carlo Simulation for structural reliability analysis. This paper proposes three modifications of the AK-MCS method to reduce the number of calls to the performance function. The first modification is related to the definition of an initial Design of Experiments (DoE). In the original AK-MCS method, an initial DoE is created by a random selection of samples among the Monte Carlo population. Therefore, samples in the failure region have fewer chances to be selected, because a small number of samples are usually located in the failure region compared to the safe region. The proposed method in this paper is based on a uniform selection of samples in the predefined domain, so more samples may be selected from the failure region. Another important parameter in the AK-MCS method is the size of the initial DoE. The algorithm may not predict the exact limit state surface with an insufficient number of initial samples. Thus, the second modification of the AK-MCS method is proposed to overcome this problem. The third modification is relevant to the type of regression trend in the AK-MCS method. The original AK-MCS method uses an ordinary Kriging model, so the regression part of Kriging model is an unknown constant value. In this paper, the effect of regression trend in the AK-MCS method is investigated for a benchmark problem, and it is shown that the appropriate choice of regression type could reduce the number of calls to the performance function. A stepwise approach is also presented to select a suitable trend of the Kriging model. The numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed modifications.

AB  - The reliability analysis of structural systems is generally difficult when limit state function (LSF) is implicitly defined especially by black-box models in engineering. To balance analysis efficiency and accuracy, an improved approach named BIS-FC is proposed in this paper based on the Beta-spherical importance sampling (BIS) framework with the innovative concept of critical region defined by combination with First Order Reliability Method (FORM). The critical region is defined by the hyper-tangent plane of LSF at the Most Probable Point (MPP) and its parallel hyperplanes according to the convex or concave features of LSF, wherein the samples are of both high occurrence probability and high misjudgment risk due to the linearization assumption of FORM. BIS-FC only conducts LSF analysis for the BIS samples located in the critical region, and the other samples are directly identified as safe or failure according to the linearized hyperplanes. Thus large computational cost can be saved compared to the original BIS, and meanwhile, the analysis accuracy can be greatly enhanced compared to FORM. An iterative process is proposed to properly define the critical region, based on which reliability is analyzed sequentially until the stopping criteria for desired estimation error level and stable convergence are satisfied. The algorithms of BIS-FC for both single and multiple MPP situations are developed and testified with six numerical examples and one satellite structural engineering problem. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of BIS-FC regarding good balance between efficiency and accuracy.

AB  - Surrogate models can provide an effective tool to improve the computational efficiency for geotechnical reliability analysis when direct evaluations of the original performance function (OPF) of a geotechnical structure are time-consuming. However, selection of a proper surrogate model is often problem dependent. A particular surrogate model may not suitable for different geotechnical structures. Meanwhile, training of the surrogate model sometimes can also cost significant computational time. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient and robust geotechnical reliability analysis method based on the adaptive ensemble model of radial basis functions (AERBF) and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The ensemble of multiple radial basis functions (RBFs) is constructed to replace the OPF of a geotechnical system, which can improve the robustness of the surrogate model. The ensemble model does not need to select a certain RBF but automatically determines the weight coefficients of each component RBF through the training process, which can avoid the possible selection of an improper RBF. An active learning function is adopted to select the most suitable training samples to train the ensemble model, which can improve the efficiency significantly. Several representative examples are illustrated to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. The results show that the approach is robust to different kinds of geotechnical systems. It can accurately estimate the failure probability of geotechnical systems with a small number of evaluations of the OPF.

AB  - Because of many deficiencies of traditional drilling accident diagnosing and processing systems, for instance, these system were mostly based on static information from ground, so it was difficult to accurately distinguish the "down hole" accidents in real time, and they could not permit multi-user collaboration and share information. So an intelligent diagnosis and processing system for drilling accidents supported by computer networks is put forward to develop. According to levels and working environment of users, the architecture of this system is designed, which is generally divided into two levels: onsite and base level. Models of intelligent diagnosis and processing for drilling accidents are built by case-based reasoning techniques. And through Ajax technique, the asynchronous communication between the client and server is realized to increase the response speed of the server. On the basis of the above, combining the technology of Web Service, an intelligent diagnosis and processing system for drilling accidents is implemented. The system, which collected all kinds of accident's cases occurred in oil fields and could makes full use of all types of information (especially real-time information while drilling) as well as multi-domain experts' experience and knowledge, has self-learning function and can realize the diagnosis and processing for all kinds of drilling accidents. At the same time, the system provides an intact knowledge handbook of preventing and process accidents, as well as an information-sharing platform for multi-domain experts and technicians to make decisions collaboratively. Using the system can effectively improve diagnosis and processing accidents in terms of accuracy.

TI  - Thermal profiling for IC chip high-voltage stress prediction
T2  - THERMOSENSE XXV
CP  - Conference on Thermosense XXV
AB  - Integrated Circuit (IC) chips constantly undergo different types of stress in the field, such as thermal, humidity, and electrical stress. Existing work has concentrated on humidity and thermal stress; there has been relatively little emphasis on high-voltage stress level prediction. The objectives of this investigation were to 1) explore the impact of high-voltage stress on IC functionality, (2) observe heating rate changes in chips under high-voltage stress over time, and (3) predict stress levels using artificial neural network models.
   Three different kinds of IC chips-namely, LM348N Operational Amplifier, LM386N-1 Power Amplifier, and LM555CN Timer Oscillator-were studied. Each chip was taken from a different printed circuit board. An artificial neural network model with a 3-2-1 topology was constructed to predict stress level given heating rate over time. Results indicate (1) high-voltage stress shortens the lifecycle of IC chips, (2) heating rate increases are relatively great in the first few minutes, then reach a steady state, and (3) neural network models can predict stress level with good accuracy. The detection rates for the Amplifier chips (LM348N and LM386N) were 97% and 91%, respectively. The detection rate for the LM555CN chip was around 75%; however those results may be improved with more samples for training and evaluation. In addition, the trainRP learning function resulted in a lower error rate (for the LM348N chip) with the original experimental data than other learning functions such as trainGD and trainCGP. Future directions include the expansion of the study to other types of IC chips, such as memory and microprocessor chips.

AB  - This study proposes a new reliability-based capacity factor calibration method based on the EN 1990 Annex D method in combination with Kriging for a statistical data expansion. The original EN 1990 Annex D method has been widely used in partial safety factor or capacity factor calibrations in international structural design standards by rigorously considering the modelling error of the design equations in comparison with real experimental data. However, as the number of experimental data is often limited in practical situations, large statistical uncertainty needs to be incorporated in the safety factor calibration process, and the calibrated partial safety factors or capacity factors have large variations. In the proposed method, Kriging, a data-driven nonlinear interpolation method, is utilised to statistically expand the experimental database used for modelling error estimation when experimental data are limited. To make the calculation rigorous, the Kriging error of the statistically expanded data is also estimated and incorporated into the proposed framework. The proposed method is demonstrated through two numerical examples and three real world structural design examples including the shear strength of reinforced concrete beams and the axial resistance of concrete-filled steel tubular stub columns with circular and rectangular sections, each of which has more than 300 experimental data for verification. The results show that the proposed method always improves the calibration results by statistical data expansion, which does not need any additional physical costs for experiments.

AB  - The moment-independent global sensitivity method is an important branch among the prosperous developments of global sensitivity analysis. It can quantify the influence of input variables on the uncertainty of model output by taking the entire distribution ranges into account. However, the fast and accurate estimation still remains a challenging task in engineering practices. This article aims at developing a robust and efficient sensitivity analysis approach by leveraging the superiority of Bayesian active learning technology. An algorithm called active learning of cumulative distribution function (AL-CDF) is proposed to efficiently derive an accurate CDF of model output with a small group of training data. In AL-CDF algorithm, a modified U-learning function is defined to determine the best point to guide the learning process of CDF. Moreover, an innovative stopping criterion is specially designed based on functional samples of posterior Gaussian process, aided by an advanced Gaussian process generator. Once the AL-CDF is completed, the Bayesian inference of moment-independent indices by empirical-Copula method can be directly applied in a pure statistic manner, with no more evaluations of the complex performance function. From this perspective, the main computational cost is consumed in the AL-CDF procedure. In addition, benefiting from the sampling strategy from posterior GPR model, the posterior variations of moment-independent sensitivity indices can be derived as by-products. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed work is demonstrated by a nonlinear numerical example, a wing flutter model as well as the NASA Langley multidisciplinary challenge.

AB  - Pavlov conditioning is a typical associative memory, which involves associative learning between the gustatory and auditory cortex, known as Pavlov associative memory. Inspired by neural mechanisms and biological phenomena of Pavlov associative memory, this paper proposes a multi-functional memristive Pavlov associative memory circuit. In addition to learning and forgetting, whose rates change with the number of associative learning times, the circuit also achieves other innovative functions. First, consolidation learning, which refers to the continued learning process after acquiring associative memory, changes the rates of learning and forgetting. Secondly, the natural forgetting rate tends to zero when the associative memory has been acquired several times, which means the formation of long-term memory. Thirdly, the generalization and differentiation of associative memory caused by similar stimuli are realized through a simplified memristive feedforward neural network. Besides, this circuit implements the associative learning function of interval stimuli through a simpler structure, which refers to "the longer the stimuli interval, the slower the learning rate". The above functions are realized by the time interval module, variable rates module, and generalization and differentiation module. It has been shown that the proposed circuit has good robustness, and can reduce the influence of parasitic capacitance, memristive conductance drift, and input noise on circuit functions. Through further research, this circuit is expected to be used in robot platforms to realize human-like perception and associative cognitive functions.

AB  - Previously, we have shown that chronic treatment with allopregnanolone (ALLO) for three months impaired learning function in the Swe/PS1 mouse model. ALLO is a neurosteroid, produced in the CNS and a GABA(A) receptor agonist. ALLO modulates the general inhibitory system in the CNS by enhancing the effect of GABA. Chronic treatment with other GABA(A) receptor active compounds, such as benzodiazepines, ethanol and medroxy-progesterone acetate has been associated to cognitive decline and/or increased risk for dementia. In this study, we sufficed with a treatment period of one month for the Swe/PS1 mouse, and included another Alzheimer's disease mouse model; the Swe/Arc model. We found that one month of chronic treatment with elevated ALLO levels within physiological range impaired learning and memory function in the Swe/Arc female and male mice. Male Swe/PS1 mice also showed marginally impaired function, while the female mice did not. Furthermore, the chronic ALLO treatment caused increased levels of soluble A beta in the Swe/PS1 mouse model while the levels were unchanged in the Swe/Arc model. Therefore, both Swe/Arc and Swe/PS1 mice showed signs of accelerated disease progression. Still, further studies are required to determine the mechanisms behind the cognitive impairment and the increased A beta-levels caused by mildly elevated ALLO-levels.

AB  - This research mainly focuses on the humanoid robot's recognition model for the multiple targets and complex color. The purpose of this research is to apply visual detection technology on a humanoid robot and propose a real time image extraction method to enhance the robot's visual application like a human. The multi-target objects and complex color experiments for various geometric shapes were conducted using humanoid robot NAO. The main procedure of the humanoid robot performing the operation of the multiple targets and complex color is as follows: firstly, the image is acquired by the vision system mounted on the camera of the humanoid robot; secondly, the pixel position of the object point is obtained through the image processing; furthermore, the outer shape position is set for the humanoid robot and then the improvement is performed to let it become more efficiencies. These experimental results demonstrate it can successfully identify the target objects and their outer contour, and also through the learning function in the Choregraphe platform, it can learn more complex definitions on the outer contour such as bottle and book and their recognition. The superiority of the proposed work is that it can be for various complex conditions. In the three-dimensional environment, the visual system of the NAO robot was firstly used to perceive its surrounding environment, and then the image processing technology was used to identify the chess position. The first general remark is that this work can be conceived as a good technological/engineering achievement.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to examine specific learning functions among people coping with schizophrenia and the possibility of a relationship between the different aspects of learning function (e.g., reading or writing) and the severity of the mental illness. We hypothesized that (a) the basic learning functions of people with schizophrenia after the first episode of the disease would be low compared with the general population, but (b) there would be broad intra-individual variance in the degree of damage to the different functions, and (c) this intra-individual variance would be associated with the severity of the illness. The sample comprised 38 schizophrenia patients, ages 20-37, who were hospitalized in two psychiatric hospitals in northern Israel. The learning functions were examined using MATAL., a computerized set of standardized tests and questionnaires developed for the diagnosis of learning disabilities among higher education students in Israel. The results supported the first two hypotheses; the learning functions of the participants were significantly lower than the norm in the general population on all tasks and there was variance among individuals regarding the different functions. However, inconsistent with our third hypothesis, no correlation was found between this variance and the severity of the illness. The findings provide initial support for the presence of learning disabilities among patients with schizophrenia. Further research is recommended to better understand this subject and evaluate the need for diagnosis and intervention.

AB  - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have garnered escalating significance in response to the evolving landscape of cyberattacks, driven by the adaptability and versatility of Software Defined Networking (SDN)-based networks in enhancing security orchestration. Although Machine Learning (ML) models have been developed for IDS, they require large amounts of labeled data to achieve high performance. However, acquiring labels for attacks is a time-consuming process and can cause problems in deploying the existing ML models in new systems or lower performance due to a shortage of labeled data on pre-trained datasets. Additionally, such ML based IDS models lack the self-learning function to automatically adapt to new cyberattacks during network operations. To overcome these challenges, our work proposes Fed-Evolver, automated evolving approach for federated IDS that combines Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with Auto Encoder (AE) and a semi-supervised adversarial Autoencoder (SSAAE) for spotting intrusion actions. Our Fed-Evolver leverages supervised and unsupervised learning strategies to build efficient IDS models in the context of labeled data scarcity with the help of Federated Learning (FL). It allows data owners to collaborate for training intrusion detection models to provide the self-evolving capability in SDN-enabled networks. Our proposed framework is evaluated on 6 cyberattack datasets, including CICIDS2018, CIC-ToN-IoT, NFUNSW-NB15, InSDN, InSecLab-IDS2021, DNP3 Intrusion Detection, and it outperforms other ML methods even when trained with only 1% proportion of labeled data, achieving consistently high performance across all metrics on the datasets.

AB  - Hypertension is called the silent killer because it has no symptoms and can cause serious trouble if left untreated for a long time. It has a major role for stroke, heart attacks, heart failure, aneurysms of the arteries, peripheral arterial diseases, chronic kidney disease etc. An intelligent and accurate diagnostic system is mandatory for better diagnosis and treatment of hypertension patients. This study develops a fuzzy expert system to diagnose the hypertension risk for different patients based on a set of symptoms and rules. Next we design a neuro fuzzy system for the same set of symptoms and rules using three different types of learning algorithms which are Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), Gradient Descent (GD) and Bayesian Resolution (BR) based learning functions. Then this paper presents a comparative study between fuzzy expert system (FES) and feed forward back propagation based neuro fuzzy system (NFS) for hypertension diagnosis. This paper also presents a comparison among the learning functions (LM, GD and BR) where Levenberg-Marquardt based learning function shows its efficiency over the others. Comparison between FES and NFS shows the effectiveness of using NFS over FES. Here, the input data set has been collected from 10 patients whose ages are between 20 and 40 years, both for male and female. The input parameters taken are age, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), and heart rate. The diagnosis process, linguistic variables and their values were modeled based on expert's knowledge and from existing database.

AB  - System reliability analysis aims at computing the probability of failure of an engineering system given a set of uncertain inputs and limit state functions. Active -learning solution schemes have been shown to be a viable tool but as of yet they are not as efficient as in the context of component reliability analysis. This is due to some peculiarities of system problems, such as the presence of multiple failure modes and their uneven contribution to failure, or the dependence on the system configuration (e.g., series or parallel). In this work, we propose a novel active learning strategy designed for solving general system reliability problems. This algorithm combines subset simulation and Kriging/PC-Kriging, and relies on an enrichment scheme tailored to specifically address the weaknesses of this class of methods. More specifically, it relies on three components: (i) a new learning function that does not require the specification of the system configuration, (ii) a density -based clustering technique that allows one to automatically detect the different failure modes, and (iii) sensitivity analysis to estimate the contribution of each limit state to system failure so as to select only the most relevant ones for enrichment. The proposed method is validated on two analytical examples and compared against results gathered in the literature. Finally, a complex engineering problem related to power transmission is solved, thereby showcasing the efficiency of the proposed method in a real -case scenario.

AB  - Sampling methods are powerful tools for structural reliability analysis with complex failure domains due to their stability and accuracy. One of the most frequently used sampling methods is the importance sampling (IS) method, which can markedly reduce the sampling variance and computational costs. The pivotal problem in IS method is the determination of the IS probability density function (ISPDF), which influences the accuracy and efficiency of reliability analysis greatly. This study proposes an effective method for constructing the ISPDF, combining the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm (HMC) with the Gaussian mixture model. The HMC is superior to the common Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm in convergence, which is helpful in improving sampling efficiency. Our ISPDF is generated adaptively and does not require the most probable failure point (MPFP); therefore, it can also work well for multiple MPFPs and high-nonlinear problems. To release the computational burden further, the performance function is replaced with the Kriging model, and the well-known U criterion is used for its refinement. In the proposed method, the process of the refinement of the Kriging model is coupled with the HMC sampling for constructing the ISPDF, which is the difference between some common methods; thus, no samples are vain. We verify the proposed method using three classical numerical examples and one practical engineering problem. Results show that the proposed method is accurate and superior to common IS methods in efficiency.

AB  - Group behavior recognition is the task of inferring the collective action of people that have interaction among them in the contextual scenes. The challenge is harder when face with different individual actions. Hierarchical structure model based on deep learning tackles this problem with multi-stages spatio-temporal information modeling. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed for extracting the spatial features of scene and person-level. The other component, recurrent neural network (RNN) is aimed to capture temporal feature of the person trajectories in contextual scenes. However, in some prior works, to get the trajectory information in this framework still rely on a third-party tracker that makes the solution not in an end-to-end framework. The exist end-to-end solution incorporates matching strategy in Euclidean space that implicitly tracks the corresponding states as input of RNN unit.
   In this work, we propose an improved RNN matching strategy by explicitly transform the feature in Euclidean space by distance learning function. Our distance function is based on simple Siamese network with two sub network share the same weights. The network consists of the learned feature based on unsupervised dictionary learning as an intermediate layer between raw input and fully connected layers with non-linear activation and regularization. Our proposed method can yield a little improvement in the applied group behavior recognition framework and yet empirically prove that it can be brought into another task without change the hyper-parameter.

AB  - Automatic bug localization, i.e., automatically locating potential buggy source files given a bug report, plays an essential role in software engineering. For instance, bug localization helps developers fix bugs quickly. Although information retrieval-based bug localization methods are simple and easy to understand, it is difficult for them to bridge the lexical gap between bug reports and programs and capture the rich structural information in programs. Deep learning-based bug localization (DLBL) methods can utilize the structural information of the program, but they cannot handle long code sequences well. For example, CNN fails to capture remote code interaction features, while RNN (like LSTM, GRU) is vulnerable to gradient disappearance or burst when facing long code sequences. Additionally, DLBL methods fail to model metadata features such as bug-fixing recency and frequency. In this paper, we research how to locate buggy files by learning function-level features. Specifically, we propose a new framework called FLIM that can extract semantic features of a program at the function level and then calculates the relevance between natural and programming language by aggregating function-level interactions. We leverage a fine-tuned language model to treat the bug localization task as a code retrieval task, and use a learning-to-rank model to fuse the function-level semantic features with IR features to calculate the final relevance. We evaluate FLIM by conducting extensive experiments on widely-used six software projects. Experimental results demonstrate that FLIM outperforms six state-of-the-art methods of bug localization.

AB  - There lacks fuzzy reliability analysis model to assess the reliability level of time-dependent multi-mode system (T-sys) under fuzzy uncertainty, thus this paper defines T-sys failure possibility firstly to address this problem. Then fuzzy simulation is proposed for estimating the failure possibility of T-sys (T-sys-FS), in which the failure possibility estimation of T-sys is transformed into searching fuzzy design point, a failure point with the largest joint membership degree. To improve the efficiency of T-sys-FS for searching fuzzy design point, adaptive Kriging is inserted into T-sys-FS to establish a more efficient method shorten as T-sys-AK-FS. By use of the relationship between the failure state of T-sys and that of transient single mode, a new learning function is proposed in T-sys-AK-FS, on which the critical mode and critical instant may be selected for efficiently updating Kriging model of T-sys performance function. Additionally, based on the partial correct information provided by the current Kriging model and the properties of the fuzzy design point, an improved T-sys-AK-FS version (T-sys-AK-FSi) is proposed by combining the candidate sample pool reduction strategy, then the computational efficiency is enhanced further for searching the T-sys fuzzy design point. Several examples are presented to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods. (c) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

CP  - 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (IEEE EMBC)
AB  - The decision- making process of human are being researched in association with making psychological models and experiment technique. However, there is no mathematical models using transfer functions for representing such process as far as the authors know. In this research, a model of the decision-making process was constructed, which was consisting of proportional, integrator, and derivative elements. And, the coefficients of the each element, Kp, Ki, and Kd, were individually identified by the least-square method, using the input-output data obtained in the computer simulation game of gold trading, which was created especially for this research.
   In the result, Ki/Kp, the coefficient ratio between the integrator element and the proportional element, and Kd/Kp, that between the derivative element and the proportional element, were different for each individual. As these differences can be regarded as individual differences, the constructed model is considered to achieve the representation of individual properties, which is the aim of this research.
   However, in this created game, the recall ratio of Ki/Kp and Kd/Kp was not high respectively, the average of them was only 15%. This low recall ratio can be due to the inadequacy of the game used for the identification, or the unsuitability of the structure of the constructed model. Thus, the improvement of the gold trading game and model's structure are the next challenges. Especially, the addition of learning function to the model of the decision-making process is one of the desirable challenges, because it could work even in short and repeated process like gold trading.

AB  - High-precision time-dependent reliability analysis (TDRA) is essential for small failure probability estimation and life-cycle design and maintenance for engineering structures of high importance. However, existing small failure probability estimation methods, e.g., subset simulation (SS) and importance sampling (IS), might face challenges in accurate TDRA with relatively low computational costs. Thus, this paper presents a novel TDRA method for small failure probability based on point evolution kernel density (PKDE) and adaptive SS. To efficiently reduce the computational burden, single-loop surrogate modeling (SLSM) is employed, and TDRA is implemented by capturing the cumulative density function (CDF) of the first failure time. The proposed method is called Firstfailure-Time-PKDE-Adaptive-Surrogate-modeling-based-SS (FT-PASS). In FT-PASS, good-lattice-point-setPartially-Stratified-Sampling (GLP-PSS) is performed to select uniform initial points and achieve the initial TDRA by PKDE. Subsequently, a Kriging model is built and trained by an advanced learning function to obtain the distribution of the first failure time with SS and revise the initial TDRA. Four different cases, a numerical case, a corroded steel beam, a turbine blade subject to stochastic loads, and a planar steel truss subject to stochastic load and corrosion effect, are used to validate FT-PASS. The results indicate that FT-PASS can accurately estimate time-dependent small failure probability and strike a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy compared with conventional TDRA methods.

AB  - In contemporary higher education systems, the processes of assessment and feedback are often seen as coexisting activities. As a result, they have become entangled in both policy and practice, resulting in a conceptual and practical blurring of their unique purposes. In this paper, we present a critical examination of the issues created by the entanglement of assessment and feedback, arguing that it is important to ensure that the legitimate purposes of both feedback and assessment are not compromised by inappropriate conflation of the two. We situate our argument in the shifting conceptual landscape of feedback, where there is increasing emphasis on students being active players in feedback processes working with and applying information from others to future learning tasks, rather than regarding feedback as a mechanism of transmission of information by teachers. We surface and critically discuss six problems created by the entanglement of assessment and feedback: students' focus on grades; comments justifying grades rather than support learning; feedback too late to be useful; feedback subordinated to all other processes in course design; overemphasis on documentation of feedback; and the downgrading of feedback created by requirements for anonymous marking. We then propose a series of strategies for preserving the learning function of feedback, through models that give primacy to feedback within learning cycles. We conclude by offering suggestions for research and practice that seek to engage with the challenges created by the entanglement of assessment and feedback, and that maintain the unique purposes of assessment and feedback.

AB  - In this work, a memristive circuit with affective multi-associative learning function is proposed, which mimics the process of human affective formation. It mainly contains three modules: affective associative learning, affective formation, affective expression. The first module is composed of several affective single-associative learning circuits consisting of memristive neurons and synapses. Memristive neuron will be activated and output pulses if its input exceeds the threshold. After it is activated, memristive neuron can automatically return to the inactive state. Memristive synapse can realize learning and forgetting functions based on the signals from pre- and post-neurons. The learning rule is pre-neuron activated lags behind post-neuron for a short time; the forgetting rule is to repeatedly activate pre-neuron after the emotion is learned. The process of learning or forgetting corresponds to facilitating or inhibiting synaptic weight, that is, decreasing or increasing memristance continuously. Different voltage signals applied to memristors and different parameters of memristors would lead to different synaptic weights which indicate different affective association. The second module can convert affective signals to corresponding emotions. The formed emotions can be shown in a face by the third module. The simulation results in PSPICE show that the proposed circuit system can learn, forget and form emotions like human. If the proposed circuit is further used on a humanoid robot platform through further research, the robot will have the ability of affective interaction with human so that it can be effectively used in affective company and other aspects.

AB  - The paper presents an iterative approach based on stochastic simulations and adaptive Kriging metamodels to perform reliability and safety assessments of soil slopes. Two new rules for adaptively selecting support points are proposed, considering an entropy learning function and the closeness to the failure domain defined by a limit state function. In addition, a stopping criterion is proposed based on root-mean-square and mean absolute percentage errors computed with cross-validation at the local level, focusing on regions where the uncertainties are relevant. Finally, the selection rules for support points and the error metrics are implemented in two benchmark problems with a low, moderate, and high probability of failure. Ultimately, the work leads to an adaptive Kriging strategy for slope stability assessment, offering: (1) a fair comparison with other strategies based on a significant number of realizations, (2) a stopping criteria based on a new local error metric, (3) an insight of the behavior across different magnitudes of the probability of failure, and (4) a new selection rule that reduces the total number of support points significantly. The proposed scheme is easily paired with commercial software to compute support points, resulting in an attractive tool for practitioners.

AB  - Affective responses to anticipated and experienced outcomes have been demonstrated to predict choice in scenarios where outcomes and their probabilities are explicitly given. The relationship between feelings and choice is less well established for decision problems that require learning from experience. However, converging lines of research suggest that feelings may mediate choices in the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), a widely studied experience-based task. To investigate this relationship further, 72 participants completed a computerized version of the IGT in which they rated their subjective valence and arousal for each deck after making a choice on each trial. Reinforcement-learning (RL) models were used to examine the role of feelings as both a response to outcomes and an input to choice. Results showed that participants' valence ratings following each choice outcome were best characterized by RL models that included a prospect theory utility function and a decay learning function, with parameters for these functions varying with task performance. On average, models based on previous-trial feelings and pure RL models were equally able to predict the next choice for moderate and high performers, but low performers' previous-trial feelings were unable to predict their next choice. These results were consistent with the somatic marker hypothesis proposal that feelings guide choices for individuals who perform well in the IGT, but that low performers seem to ignore their feelings when making choices.

AB  - Inferred mechanisms of learning, such as those involved in improvements resulting from perceptual training, are reliant on (and reflect) the functional forms that models of learning take. However, previous investigations of the functional forms of perceptual learning have been limited in ways that are incompatible with the known mechanisms of learning. For instance, previous work has overwhelmingly aggregated learning data across learning participants, learning trials, or both. Here we approach the study of the functional form of perceptual learning on the by-person and by-trial levels at which the mechanisms of learning are expected to act. Each participant completed one of two visual perceptual learning tasks over the course of two days, with the first 75% of task performance using a single reference stimulus (i.e., "training") and the last 25% using an orthogonal reference stimulus (to test generalization). Five learning functions, coming from either the exponential or the power family, were fit to each participant's data. The exponential family was uniformly supported by Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) model comparisons. The simplest exponential function was the best fit to learning on a texture oddball detection task, while a Weibull (augmented exponential) function tended to be the best fit to learning on a dot-motion discrimination task. The support for the exponential family corroborated previous by-person investigations of the functional form of learning, while the novel evidence supporting the Weibull learning model has implications for both the analysis and the mechanistic bases of the learning.

AB  - The connection patterns of neural circuits in the brain form a complex network. Collective signalling within the network manifests as patterned neural activity and is thought to support human cognition and adaptive behaviour. Recent technological advances permit macroscale reconstructions of biological brain networks. These maps, termed connectomes, display multiple non-random architectural features, including heavy-tailed degree distributions, segregated communities and a densely interconnected core. Yet, how computation and functional specialization emerge from network architecture remains unknown. Here we reconstruct human brain connectomes using in vivo diffusion-weighted imaging and use reservoir computing to implement connectomes as artificial neural networks. We then train these neuromorphic networks to learn a memory-encoding task. We show that biologically realistic neural architectures perform best when they display critical dynamics. We find that performance is driven by network topology and that the modular organization of intrinsic networks is computationally relevant. We observe a prominent interaction between network structure and dynamics throughout, such that the same underlying architecture can support a wide range of memory capacity values as well as different functions (encoding or decoding), depending on the dynamical regime the network is in. This work opens new opportunities to discover how the network organization of the brain optimizes cognitive capacity.
   The relationship between brain organization, connectivity and computation is not well understood. The authors construct neuromorphic artificial neural networks endowed with biological connection patterns derived from diffusion-weighted imaging. The neuromorphic networks are trained to perform a memory task, revealing an interaction between network structure and dynamics.

AB  - In recent years, the clinical usefulness of the Wada test (WT) has been debated among researchers in the field. Therefore, we aimed to assess its contribution to the prediction of change in verbal learning and verbal memory function after epilepsy surgery. Data from 56 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy who underwent WT and subsequent surgery were analyzed retrospectively. Additionally, a standard neuropsychological assessment evaluating attentional, learning and memory, visuospatial, language, and executive function was performed both before and 12 months after surgery. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were used to determine the incremental value of WT results over socio-demographic, clinical, and neuropsychological characteristics in predicting postsurgical change in patients' verbal learning and verbal memory function. The incorporation of WT results significantly improved the prediction models of postsurgical change in verbal learning (R-2=0.233, p=.032) and verbal memory function (R-2=0.386, p=.005). Presurgical performance and WT scores accounted for 41.8% of the variance in postsurgical change in verbal learning function, and 51.1% of the variance in postsurgical change in verbal memory function. Our findings confirm that WT results are of significant incremental value for the prediction of postsurgical change in verbal learning and verbal memory function. Thus, the WT contributes to determining the risks of epilepsy surgery and, therefore, remains an important part of the presurgical work-up of selected patients with clear clinical indications.

AB  - A new trend in deep learning, represented by Mutual Information Neural Estimation (MINE) and Information Noise Contrast Estimation (InfoNCE), is emerging. In this trend, similarity functions and Estimated Mutual Information (EMI) are used as learning and objective functions. Coincidentally, EMI is essentially the same as Semantic Mutual Information (SeMI) proposed by the author 30 years ago. This paper first reviews the evolutionary histories of semantic information measures and learning functions. Then, it briefly introduces the author's semantic information G theory with the rate-fidelity function R(G) (G denotes SeMI, and R(G) extends R(D)) and its applications to multi-label learning, the maximum Mutual Information (MI) classification, and mixture models. Then it discusses how we should understand the relationship between SeMI and Shannon's MI, two generalized entropies (fuzzy entropy and coverage entropy), Autoencoders, Gibbs distributions, and partition functions from the perspective of the R(G) function or the G theory. An important conclusion is that mixture models and Restricted Boltzmann Machines converge because SeMI is maximized, and Shannon's MI is minimized, making information efficiency G/R close to 1. A potential opportunity is to simplify deep learning by using Gaussian channel mixture models for pre-training deep neural networks' latent layers without considering gradients. It also discusses how the SeMI measure is used as the reward function (reflecting purposiveness) for reinforcement learning. The G theory helps interpret deep learning but is far from enough. Combining semantic information theory and deep learning will accelerate their development.

AB  - Evaluating the failure probability of engineering structures involving implicit performance functions generally requires time-consuming finite element simulations. The computational effort is usually unbearable, especially for small failure probability. This paper proposes a new reliability analysis method combining relevance vector machine and subset simu-lation importance sampling, which guarantees the accuracy of results and improves the computational efficiency. In this method, relevance vector machine is first applied to ap-proximate relatively coarse limit states. Then, subset simulation importance sampling is executed based on the constructed relevance vector machine. To improve the prediction accuracy, samples from first and last level are used to refine relevance vector machine. Since only the samples of last level are involved in the calculation of the failure probabil-ity, and the updated relevance vector machine has a very high prediction accuracy for the samples of last level, the obtained failure probability is extremely accurate. In addition, the samples are predicted by the well-constructed relevance vector machine rather than eval-uated with real performance functions, which drastically decreases the calculation time. To reduce redundant iterations in the update process, a novel learning function based on the current design of experiment position and a stopping condition based on error estimation of reliability prediction are employed. Furthermore, the K-means clustering algorithm is utilized to implement the ability of surrogate model-based subset simulation importance sampling to handle multiple failure mode problems. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are verified by four examples involving different types of features.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BHD), a classic traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, has been used for recovering neurological dysfunctions and treating post-stroke disability in China for 200 years. In the present study, we investigated the effects of BHD on inhibiting neuronal apoptosis, promoting proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) and neurite formation and enhancing learning and memory functional recovery in an experimental rat ischemic stroke model. BHD significantly reduced infarct volume and decreased cell apoptosis in the ischemic brain. BHD enhanced neuronal cell viability in vitro. BHD dose-dependently promoted the proliferation of NSCs in ischemic rat brains in vivo. Moreover, BHD promoted neuronal and astrocyte differentiation in primary cultured NSCs in vitro. Water maze test revealed that BHD promoted the recovery of learning function but not memory functions in the transient ischemic rats. We then investigated the changes of the cellular signaling molecules by using two-dimension (2D) gel electrophoresis and focused on the PI3K/Akt/Bad and Jak2/Stat3/cyclin D1signaling pathway to uncover its underlying mechanisms for its neuroprotective and neurogenetic effects. BHD significantly upregulated the expression of p-PI3K, p-Akt, and p-Bad as well as the expression of p-Jak, p-Stat3, and cyclin D1 in vitro and in vivo. In addition, BHD upregulated Hes1 and downregulated cav-1in vitroand in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that BHD has neuroprotective effects and neurogenesis-promoting effects via activating PI3K/Akt/Bad and Jak2/Stat3/Cyclin D1 signaling pathways.

TI  - SALAD : Source-free Active Label-Agnostic Domain Adaptation for Classification, Segmentation and Detection
T2  - 2023 IEEE/CVF WINTER CONFERENCE ON APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTER VISION (WACV)
CP  - 23rd IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)
AB  - We present a novel method, SALAD, for the challenging vision task of adapting a pre-trained "source" domain network to a "target" domain, with a small budget for annotation in the "target" domain and a shift in the label space. Further, the task assumes that the source data is not available for adaptation, due to privacy concerns or otherwise. We postulate that such systems need to jointly optimize the dual task of (i) selecting fixed number of samples from the target domain for annotation and (ii) transfer of knowledge from the pre-trained network to the target domain. To do this, SALAD consists of a novel Guided Attention Transfer Network (GATN) and an active learning function, H-AL. The GATN enables feature distillation from pre-trained network to the target network, complemented with the target samples mined by H-AL using transfer-ability and uncertainty criteria. SALAD has three key benefits: (i) it is task-agnostic, and can be applied across various visual tasks such as classification, segmentation and detection; (ii) it can handle shifts in output label space from the pre-trained source network to the target domain; (iii) it does not require access to source data for adaptation. We conduct extensive experiments across 3 visual tasks, viz. digits classification (MNIST, SVHN, VISDA), synthetic (GTA5) to real (CityScapes) image segmentation, and document layout detection (PubLayNet to DSSE). We show that our source-free approach, SALAD, results in an improvement of 0.5%-31.3% (across datasets and tasks) over prior adaptation methods that assume access to large amounts of annotated source data for adaptation. Code is available here.

AB  - In this paper I propose an evolutionary model of human status that expands upon an earlier model proposed by Henrich and Gil-White Evolution and Human Behavior, 22,165-196 (2001). According to their model, there are two systems of status attainment in humans-"two ways to the top": the dominance route, which involves physical intimidation, a psychology of fear and hubristic pride, and provides coercive power, and the prestige route, which involves skills and knowledge (competence), a psychology of attraction to experts and authentic pride, and translates mainly into influence. The two systems would have evolved in response to different selective pressures, with attraction to experts serving a social learning function and coinciding with the evolution of cumulative culture. In this paper I argue that (1) the only one way to the top is competence because dominance itself involves competence and confers prestige, so there is no such thing as pure dominance status; (2) dominance in primates has two components: a competitive one involving physical coercion and a cooperative one involving competence-based attraction to high-ranking individuals (proto-prestige); (3) competence grants the same general type of power (dependence-based) in humans and other primates; (4) the attractiveness of high rank in primates is homologous with the admiration of experts in humans; (5) upon the evolution of cumulative culture, the attractiveness of high rank was co-opted to generate status differentials in a vast number of culturally generated domains of activity. I also discuss, in this perspective, the origins of hubristic pride, authentic pride, and nonauthoritarian leadership.

AB  - This manuscript presents a novel Bayesian active learning reliability method integrating both Bayesian failure probability estimation and Bayesian decision-theoretic multi-point enrichment process. First, an epistemic uncertainty measure called integrated margin probability (IMP) is proposed as an upper bound for the mean absolute deviation of failure probability estimated by Kriging. Then, adhering to the Bayesian decision theory, a look-ahead learning function called multi-point stepwise margin reduction (MSMR) is defined to quantify the possible reduction of IMP brought by adding a batch of new samples in expectation. The cost-effective implementation of MSMR-based multi-point enrichment process is conducted by three key workarounds: (a) Thanks to analytical tractability of the inner integral, the MSMR reduces to a single integral. (b) The remaining single integral in the MSMR is numerically computed with the rational truncation of the quadrature set. (c) A heuristic treatment of maximizing the MSMR is devised to fastly select a batch of best next points per iteration, where the prescribed scheme or adaptive scheme is used to specify the batch size. The proposed method is tested on two benchmark examples and two dynamic reliability problems. The results indicate that the adaptive scheme in the MSMR gains a good balance between the computing resource consumption and the overall computational time. Then, the MSMR fairly outperforms those existing leaning functions and parallelization strategies in terms of the accuracy of failure probability estimate, the number of iterations, as well as the number of performance function evaluations, especially in complex dynamic reliability problems.

AB  - BackgroundSpinal cord and brain atrophy are common in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) but harbor distinct patterns accounting for disability and cognitive impairment.MethodsThis study included 209 NMOSD and 304 RRMS patients and 436 healthy controls. Non-negative matrix factorization was used to parse differences in spinal cord and brain atrophy at subject level into distinct patterns based on structural MRI. The weights of patterns were obtained using a linear regression model and associated with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and cognitive scores. Additionally, patients were divided into cognitive impairment (CI) and cognitive preservation (CP) groups.ResultsThree patterns were observed in NMOSD: (1) Spinal Cord-Deep Grey Matter (SC-DGM) pattern was associated with high EDSS scores and decline of visuospatial memory function; (2) Frontal-Temporal pattern was associated with decline of language learning function; and (3) Cerebellum-Brainstem pattern had no observed association. Patients with CI had higher weights of SC-DGM pattern than CP group. Three patterns were observed in RRMS: (1) DGM pattern was associated with high EDSS scores, decreased information processing speed, and decreased language learning and visuospatial memory functions; (2) Frontal-Temporal pattern was associated with overall cognitive decline; and (3) Occipital pattern had no observed association. Patients with CI trended to have higher weights of DGM and Frontal-Temporal patterns than CP group.ConclusionThis study estimated the heterogeneity of spinal cord and brain atrophy patterns in NMOSD and RRMS patients at individual level, and evaluated the clinical relevance of these patterns, which may contribute to stratifying participants for targeted therapy.

AB  - Introduction:The disabling effects of dementia, an incurable disease with little effect on mortality, affect society far more than many other conditions.Objective:The aim of this study was to stop or delay the onset of dementia using low-cost methods such as physical exercise.Methods:Senescence-accelerated model-prone (SAMP) 10 mice were made to perform a user-friendly shaking exercise for 25 weeks. The motor function and hippocampal functions (learning, spatial cognition) of the mice were evaluated using behavioral experiments. The degree of hippocampal aging was evaluated based on brain morphology. The association between behavioral performance of the mice and the degree of hippocampal aging was then evaluated.Results:The behavioral test results showed that the shaking group had higher motor coordination (p< 0.01) and motor learning (p< 0.05). Significantly higher performances in the learning ability were observed in the shaking group at a middle-period experiment (p< 0.05); the spatial cognitive functions also improved (p< 0.05). The shaking group showed delayed ageing of cells in the dentate gyrus (DG; area:p< 0.01) and cornu Ammonis (CA; area:p< 0.01) regions of the hippocampus.Conclusions:The shaking exercise enhances the activity of mice and reduces age-associated decreases in learning and spatial cognitive functions. Regarding hippocampal morphology, shaking exercise can prevent non-functional protein accumulation, cell atrophy, and cell loss. Specifically, shaking exercise protects cell growth and regeneration in the DG area and enhances the learning function of the hippocampus. Furthermore, shaking exercise maintained the spatial cognitive function of cells in the CA3 and CA1 regions, and prevented the chronic loss of CA2 transmission that decreased the spatial memory decline in mice.

AB  - Primary cerebellar agenesis (PCA), a brain disease where the cerebellum does not develop, is an extremely rare congenital disease with only eleven living cases reported thus far. Studies of the PCA case will thus provide valuable insights into the necessity of cerebellar development for controlling and modulating cognitive functions of the brain. In this follow-up study, we further investigated the performance of associative learning and time perception of a 26-year-old female complete PCA case. We assessed whether delayed eyeblink conditioning (EBC), which represents prototypical associative motor learning function of the cerebellum, could be partially compensated by the extracerebellar brain regions in complete absence of the cerebellum. We also assessed whether the cerebellum, a critical brain region for millisecond-range interval timing, is essential for perception of the second-range time interval. Twelve neurotypical age-matched individuals were used as controls. We found that although the complete PCA patient had only mild to moderate motor deficits, she was unable to perform the delayed EBC even after 1-week of extensive training. Additionally, the PCA patient also performed poorly during time reproduction experiments in which she overproduced the millisecond-range time intervals, while under produced the second-range time intervals. The PCA patient also failed to perform the temporal eyeblink conditioning with a 5 s fixed interval as the conditioned stimulus. These results indicate that the cerebellum is indispensable for associative motor learning and involved in timing of sub-second intervals, as well as in the perception of second-range intervals.

AB  - Path planning in dynamic environment is a great challenge for mobile robot. A large number of approaches have been used to deal with it. Since the neural network algorithm has the ability to find the optimal solution at high speed and self-learning function, it has achieved extensive applications in the path planning tasks. Considering that the optimization performance of the neural network heavily depends on the quality of the training sample, this paper proposes a novel way to provide the training samples for the neural network. Work space of the robot is divided into two parts: global safe area and local dangerous area. In the global safe area, the robot only receives the attraction force from the target and it moves towards the target directly. In the dangerous area, except the attraction force, the robot also receives the repulsion force from the obstacle(s). The repulsion force and the angle between the obstacle and the target (origin of the coordinate is in the position of the robot) are used to be the inputs of the fuzzy inferencing system, and the deflection angle of the robot is the output. The final moving direction of the robot is determined by summing this deflection angle and the direction of the attraction force. The coordinates of the target and obstacle, and the moving direction of the robot corresponding to this position relationship, constitute the training samples for the neural network. Benefited from the precise moving direction obtained by the fuzzy artificial potential field algorithm, the neural network gets excellent path optimization ability. Simulation and physical experiment results demonstrate the potential of the proposed algorithm.

AB  - The goal of this study is to use the deep artificial neural network (DLNN) and support vector machines (SVM) methods to predict the biochar, bio-oil, and synthesis gas yields of the Atriplex nitens S. plant. Furthermore, the study's sensitivity analysis predicted the importance levels of factors influencing carbonization yields. Three different carbonization temperatures (400 degrees C, 500 degrees C, and 600 degrees C), two different holding times (30 and 60 min), and two different gas flow rate rates (0.2 and 0.5 L min(-1)) were used as input parameters in the DLNN and SVM models for this purpose. The DLNN method employed two hidden layers. The learning function was Levenberg-Marquardt. As activation functions, the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function and the linear transfer function were used. The network was tested with various numbers of neurons, and 21 different architectures were created using the number of neurons that produced the lowest MAE value. In the SVM model, the L1QB solver was used. According to the study's findings, the DLNN method made more accurate predictions than the SVM. The DLNN11 (R-2 = 0.987), DLNN19 (R-2 = 0.983), and DLNN7 (R-2 = 0.960) network architectures produced the best results in this method for biochar, bio-oil, and synthesis gas yield, respectively. As a result of sensitivity analysis, the effect of holding time on biochar and bio-oil yields was found to be greater than other parameters. The synthesis gas yield was most affected by the carbonization temperature.

AB  - In geotechnical engineering, surrogate modeling is a vital technique for enhancing computational efficiency when faced with limited and costly samples. However, most adaptive sequential sampling (ASS) methods use the Kriging model, which directly evaluates the uncertainty of the model at unsampled points, but they are not efficient in solving multiple output problems. A few studies use cross validation to indirectly evaluate the uncertainty of other surrogate models, which is time-consuming to repeatedly train multiple models. In addition, few methods consider input feature sensitivity, which further reduces the efficiency of ASS methods. To address these issues, this study proposes a hybrid ASS method that combines artificial neural networks with Monte Carlo dropout (ANN_MCD) and random forests (RF). The ANN is suitable for multiple output problems, and the MCD enables the ANN architecture to stochastically transform and efficiently predict uncertainty at unsampled points with a single model training. The RF evaluates input feature sensitivity, assigns weights to the sampling space based on feature sensitivity, and effectively avoids the interference of low-sensitivity features. Furthermore, two active learning functions are proposed to regulate the sampling areas on either a global scale or close to the limit state function, depending on the problem type. The study validates the efficacy of the proposed method through three representative geotechnical engineering examples: system reliability analysis of soil slope, back-analysis of soil constitutive parameters, and estimating the penetration rate in diamond drilling. The outcomes demonstrate that the proposed method has less computational cost than related studies and has more potential in addressing geotechnical sampling.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Diffuse brain injury (DBI) is a leading cause of mortality and disability among young individuals and adults worldwide. In specific cases, DBI is associated with permanent spatial learning dysfunction and motor deficits due to primary and secondary brain damage. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) is a major complex that produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the ischemic period. The complex aggravates brain damage and cell death following ischemia/reperfusion injury; however, its role in DBI remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that levels of NOX2 (a catalytic subunit of NOX) protein expression and the activation of NOX are enhanced following DBI induction in rats and are involved in aggravating secondary brain damage. A rat model of DBI was created using a modified weight-drop device. Our results demonstrated that NOX2 protein expression and NOX activity were enhanced in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus at 48 and 72 h following DBI induction. Treatment with apocynin (50 mg/kg body weight), a specific inhibitor of NOX, injected intraperitoneally 30 min prior to DBI significantly attenuated NOX, protein expression and NOX activation. Moreover, treatment with apocynin reduced brain edema and improved spatial learning function assessed using the Morris water maze. These results reveal that treatment with apocynin may provide a new neuroprotective therapeutic strategy against DBI by diminishing the upregulation of NOX2 protein and NOX activity.

AB  - Offshore fluid tanks are critical components of offshore oil and gas infrastructure and are often subjected to external pressures that may lead to catastrophic buckling failure. Reliable assessment of their structural integrity is paramount to ensure offshore operations' safety and environmental sustainability. Traditionally, reliability assessment relies on deterministic methods or experienced formulas, which may not accurately capture uncertainties from the structural and environmental parameters. Furthermore, classical probabilistic methods for reliability assessment also have their limitations. Approximation approaches like the first-order reliability method (FORM) rely on the linearity of the problems. Sampling-based approaches for the reliability assessment, e.g., Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), require many simulations/experiments, which is unrealistic for the real engineer design and optimization process. To address this problem, this study leverages advanced machine learning techniques, named active learning reliability methods, for buckling reliability assessments of offshore fluid tanks under external pressure. One Automatic Tank Cleaning (ATC) container machine from Dynamic Well Solutions AS company is used for the reliability assessment case study. The linear buckling analysis of the ATC tank is performed using finite element methods. The uncertainties encompassing geometric characteristics, material properties, and external loads are considered for the reliability assessment. One typical active learning reliability approach, AK-MCS with U learning function, is applied to estimate the probability of failure considering different minimum buckling factor requirements. The results demonstrate that the active learning reliability approach can significantly reduce the computational cost for the buckling reliability assessment. It enables an accurate and probabilistic assessment of the buckling reliability. Applying active learning reliability techniques could facilitate structural design optimization considering uncertainties.

AB  - The influence of caffeine on behavioral functions in both healthy and schizophrenic subjects is controversial. Here we aimed to reveal the effects of repeated caffeine pre- and post-training treatments on motor and exploratory activities and cognitive functions in a reward-based test (Ambitus) along with a brain region-specific dopamine D-2 receptor profile in control and schizophrenia-like WISKET model rats. In the control animals, pretreatment caused temporary enhancement in motor activity, while permanent improvement in learning function was detected in the WISKET animals. Post-treatment produced significant impairments in both groups. Caffeine caused short-lasting hyperactivity followed by a rebound in the inactive phase determined in undisturbed circumstance. Caffeine treatment substantially enhanced the dopamine D-2 receptor mediated G-protein activation in the prefrontal cortex and olfactory bulb of both groups, while it increased in the dorsal striatum and cerebral cortex only in the WISKET animals. Caffeine enhanced the maximal binding capacity in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of WISKET animals, but it decreased in the prefrontal cortex of the control animals. Regarding the dopamine D-2 receptor mRNA expression, caffeine treatment caused significant enhancement in the prefrontal cortex of WISKET animals, while it increased the hippocampal dopamine D-2 receptor protein amount in both groups. This study highlights the disparate effects of caffeine pre- versus post-training treatments on behavioral parameters in both control and schizophrenia-like animals and the prolonged changes in the dopaminergic system. It is supposed that the delayed depressive effects of caffeine might be compensated by frequent coffee intake, as observed in schizophrenic patients.

AB  - Isoflurane was previously the major clinical anesthetic agent but is now mainly used for veterinary anesthesia. Studies have reported widespread sites of action of isoflurane, suggesting a wide array of side effects besides sedation. In the present study, we phenotyped isoflurane-treated mice to investigate the postanesthetic behavioral effects of isoflurane. We applied comprehensive behavioral test batteries comprising sensory test battery, motor test battery, anxiety test battery, depression test battery, sociability test battery, attention test battery, and learning test battery, which were started 7 days after anesthesia with 1.8% isoflurane. In addition to the control group, we included a yoked control group that was exposed to the same stress of handling as the isoflurane-treated animals before being anesthetized. Our comprehensive behavioral test batteries revealed impaired latent inhibition in the isoflurane-treated group, but the concentration of residual isoflurane in the brain was presumably negligible. The yoked control group and isoflurane-treated group exhibited higher anxiety in the elevated plus-maze test and impaired learning function in the cued fear conditioning test. No influences were observed in sensory functions, motor functions, antidepressant behaviors, and social behaviors. A number of papers have reported an effect of isoflurane on animal behaviors, but no systematic investigation has been performed. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to systematically investigate the general health, neurological reflexes, sensory functions, motor functions, and higher behavioral functions of mice exposed to isoflurane as adults. Our results suggest that the postanesthetic effect of isoflurane causes attention deficit in mice. Therefore, isoflurane must be used with great care in the clinical setting and veterinary anesthesia.

AB  - Taking the stance that two well-known word learning biases ( shape and material bias) are formed through learning ( learned bias account, LBA), we illustrated a concrete computational mechanism with "ad-hoc meaning substitution (AMS)'' hypothesis, and verified it by two computer simulations. AMS represents that when given a novel word and a corresponding instance, children create novel word meaning by using the known word meaning and the instance as an ad-hoc template. The AMS function enables fast mapping and vocabulary spurt. To describe the AMS process computationally, we introduced "word distributional prototype (WDP),'' which is the explicit representation of word meaning with an inductive learning function. Simulation 1 revealed that when a network with WDP and AMS was given a biased vocabulary reflecting young children, it demonstrated shape, material, and overgeneralized shape biases. This result suggested that a triad of word meaning induction, ad-hoc meaning substitution, and early biased vocabulary is essential for the emergence of biases. Simulation 2 introduced the notion of maturity that denoted a degree of learning convergence for each word meaning, and then the network showed neither shape nor material bias during an early small vocabulary. This result indicated that the period at which each bias emerges is decided by maturity. Though AMS consists of simpler and valider mechanisms than those proposed in previous studies, it could reproduce behavior of shape and material biases and explain their emergence process clearly. These results suggest that phenomena concerning shape and material biases are explicable with a simple ad-hoc learning instead of meta-learning among LBA or innate language-specific ones.

AB  - The optokinetic reflex (OKR) is a behavioral oculomotor response which serves to stabilize moving images on the retina. As the cerebellum is intimately involved in the adaptive control of such compensatory eye movement, the OKR has been turned to a favorable test bed for modeling and assessing cerebellar learning function. Learning process in the cerebellum consists of two distinct phases: 1) short-term learning, which is acquired by single session of behavioral training and disappears within 24 hours, and 2) long-term learning which is induced by repeating sessions and persists for days. On the other hand, emerging evidences from experimental studies indicates high level of coordination between olivary system activity and cerebellar learning. However, it is still unclear which phase of learning will be affected by olivary system disruption. In this paper, we proposed a simple model for learning adaptation and memory formation of the cerebellum. The model is capable to reproduce the OKR gain adaptation of eye movement in both long and short term phases. The simulation results were found to strongly agree with previously reported experimental data from wild type mice. As a second step, we explore the effects of irreversible olivary system lesion on the gain adaptability of OKR by cutting off the connection of climbing fiber, which originates from the inferior olive (TO) neuron. Thereafter, comparing to the normal case, the gain of OKR undergoes a significant decline in both short and long phases of learning. This suggests that the olivary system plays a critical role in both short- and long-term adaption of OKR.

AB  - In this work, a novel reliability approach for combined high and low cycle fatigue (CCF) estimation is developed by combining active learning strategy with least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) (named as ALS-SVM) surrogate model to address the multi-resources uncertainties, including working loads, material properties and model itself. Initially, a new active learner function combining LS-SVM approach with Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is presented to improve computational efficiency with fewer calls to the performance function. To consider the uncertainty of surrogate model at candidate sample points, the learning function employs k-fold cross validation method and introduces the predicted variance to sequentially select sampling. Following that, low cycle fatigue (LCF) loads and high cycle fatigue (HCF) loads are firstly estimated based on the training samples extracted from finite element (FE) simulations, and their simulated responses together with the sample points of model parameters in Coffin-Manson formula are selected as the MC samples to establish ALS-SVM model. In this analysis, the MC samples are substituted to predict the CCF reliability of turbine blades by using the built ALS-SVM model. Through the comparison of the two approaches, it is indicated that the reliability model by linear cumulative damage rule provides a non-conservative result compared with that by the proposed one. In addition, the results demonstrate that ALS-SVM is an effective analysis method holding high computational efficiency with small training samples to gain accurate fatigue reliability.

AB  - The operational safety of high-speed trains traversing ballasted bridges is contingent upon the prevention of the ballast destabilization, which can interrupt load transfer from the rail to the bridge. Current design regulations indirectly address this limit-state by specifying a threshold value for the vertical acceleration of the superstructure. This value represents the condition at which the inertial forces induced by train passage exceed the resistive forces. However, this approach is based on limited experimental data and the influence of numerous parameters remains unexplored. As a result, reliability analyses pertaining to running safety are hampered by a lack of knowledge, leading to greater epistemic uncertainties. In this study, the impact of such uncertainties on this dynamic system is investigated using surrogate-based Imprecise Structural Reliability Analysis (ISRA). For this purpose, parametric probability boxes are used to represent lower and upper bounds of the cumulative distribution function for basic random variables with epistemic uncertainties and surrogate models are adaptively trained to reduce computational costs. The obtained results show that neglecting the influence of epistemic uncertainties can lead to permissible operating train speed higher than the speed corresponding to the desired reliability level. In this study, an overestimation of about 13% was observed on average. Furthermore, the rough analyses carried out show that taking epistemic uncertainties into account can lead to a reduction of the system characteristic safety factor by up to 30%. This significant reduction underlines the importance of expanding the available knowledge on the phenomenon of ballast instability.

AB  - Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) is the process of translation of speech from one language to another. Traditional S2ST systems follow a cascaded approach, where three modules automatics speech recognition (ASR), machine translation (MT), and text-to-speech translation (TTS) are concatenated to obtain the final translated speech utterance. The cascaded nature of the system results in the propagation of errors from one module to another. This, in turn, leads to the degradation in the overall performance of the S2ST task. With the evolution of the deep learning approaches to speech processing, many attempts have been made to perform end-to-end and direct speech-to-speech translation (DS2ST). But most of these approaches rely on language transcripts in one way or the other. In this work, we aim to perform the DS2ST task without using language transcripts. In this direction we have performed three experiments: First, we have investigated the direct learning of mapping function from source to target language with the increase in the number of utterances. Second, we have analyzed how the learning function improves with an increase in the number of Bi-LSTM layers. Third, we have observed how the system behaves with the unknown speakers (not used during training) during inference. From the experiments, it has been observed that with the increase in the number of utterances and layers, the quality of translation improves. And also, with a speaker and text-dependent training of approximately 4.4 hrs of speech, the model can generate the target language utterance even for unknown speakers. Though the generated utterance quality is not that good, but intelligent to some extent to be perceived.

AB  - In recent years, it becomes a social problem that the number of deaths due to overwork is increasing. The cause of the problem is the accumulation of daily mental and physical fatigue, and the trend is expected to continue. On the other hand, in the existing studies, a fatigue measurement system using a general-purpose RGB camera has been proposed. However, in the existing system, the camera should take about one minute to capture the user's face and the recorded video is analyzed to identify the degree of fatigue, which is a heavy burden on the user. Therefore, in our previous study, we propose a new system that a short-time video of a specific user's face is created using a web camera, and the video is analyzed using the image analysis and machine learning technologies to estimate the degree of fatigue in three levels. However, to build a machine learning model, it is necessary to generate training data by capturing the user's face for a long period of time in advance. In addition, the machine learning model constructed for a specific user cannot estimate the fatigue level of other users with high accuracy. Therefore, in this study, we propose an extension function to expand advantages of the system to many users. Specifically, to estimate the degree of fatigue for many users with high accuracy and low load for the user, we propose a re-learning method that can modify the machine learning model constructed for the specific user to new models that can be used for other users.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that magnesium salts and the noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, NPS 1506, attenuated short-term cognitive deficits and histopathological changes associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI). We evaluated the longterm effects of both therapies after brain trauma. Young adult rats were subjected to parasagittal fluid-percussion brain injury and received either MgSO4 (125 mumol/400 g rat; n = 12) 15 min post-injury, NPS 1506 (1.15 mg/kg; n = 12) 15 min and 4 hr post-injury, or vehicle (n = 9) 15 min post-injury. Uninjured animals (sham) received vehicle (n = 10). Learning function in these animals was evaluated using a water maze paradigm 8 months after injury or sham treatment, and the brains were examined for cortical and hippocampal tissue loss. Compared to sham animals, injured vehicle-treated animals displayed a substantial learning dysfunction, indicated by an increased latency to find a hidden platform in the water maze (P < 0.001). No improvements in learning, however, were found for injured animals treated with NPS 1506 or MgSO4. Injury induced >30% loss of tissue in the ipsilateral cortex in vehicle-treated animals that was not reduced in animals treated with either NPS 1506 or MgSO4. Treatment with MgSO4 significantly reduced progressive tissue loss in the hippocampus (P < 0.001). These findings are the first to demonstrate long-term neuroprotection of hippocampal tissue by an acute treatment in a TBI model. These data also show that the previously reported broad efficacy of MgSO4 or NPS 1506 observed shortly after brain trauma could not be detected 8 months post-injury. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - In order to realize the deep integration of Internet and education, and realize the efficient allocation and comprehensive coverage of educational resources, the remote language learning platform based on human-computer interaction technology is proposed. The overall architecture of the system is designed with the help of PaaS and IaaS, and the hardware and software of the system are designed according to the overall architecture. In the hardware design, Hibernate framework and SpringJDBC are used to realize the interaction between business logic layer and data layer, and the interaction of language learning function and practice function. In addition, the remote wireless communication module is designed to complete the rapid communication of the system. The learning analysis model is constructed in the software design to determine the actual online learning needs of college students, and the collaborative filtering algorithm is used to recommend online interactive learning information data, so as to realize the function of long-distance language online interactive learning system in colleges and universities. The experimental results show that with the increase of the number of users, the page jump time of the three functions such as sending information, submitting homework and asking for leave are all below 0.04 s, especially the page jump time of the function of sending information always keeps the lowest. The login or registration function takes a long time to go back to the page. The maximum value is about 0.07 s. The results show that the system can still show excellent operation ability for large-scale users, and the sending information rate is fast, and the remote online interaction effect has obvious advantages.

AB  - GNSS / INS integrated navigation is widely used in dynamic navigation and positioning. However, in the case of GNSS signal failure for a long time, the accuracy of GNSS / INS integrated navigation system will drop sharply due to the error accumulation of inertial components over time, and the anti-jamming ability and reliability can't be guaranteed. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a navigation algorithm with self-learning function, which combines data denoising and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network in the traditional GNSS / INS integrated navigation. The general process of the algorithm is that when the GNSS signal is available, the velocity, yaw of INS and preprocessed IMU output are used as the input of LSTM model, the output is the position increment of GNSS. When GNSS signal is lost, the preprocessed IMU data and INS information are input into LSTM model to generate pseudo GNSS position and send it to extended Kalman filter (EKF) to correct INS navigation results. In order to obtain reliable and accurate positioning information during GPS outages, this paper proposes a data pre-processing method combining empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and wavelet threshold filtering (WTF) to process the original IMU raw measurement. First, the EMD adaptively decomposes the noisy IMU signal into a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) according to amplitude and frequency. Then, the wavelet threshold filtering is applied to high-frequency IMFs, which separates the useful information in the high-frequency IMFs. Wavelet threshold filtering using heuristic threshold and soft threshold function. Finally, these IMFs are added with IMFs of low frequency and residual signal to achieve de-noising signal. The experimental results show that the proposed navigation algorithm can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of GNSS / INS integrated navigation during GNSS outages.

TI  - Compression-Based Selective Sampling for Learning to Rank
T2  - CIKM'16: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2016 ACM CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
CP  - 25th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM)
AB  - Learning to rank (L2R) algorithms use a labeled training set to generate a ranking model that can be later used to rank new query results. These training sets are very costly and laborious to produce, requiring human annotators to assess the relevance or order of the documents in relation to a query. Active learning (AL) algorithms are able to reduce the labeling effort by actively sampling an unlabeled set and choosing data instances that maximize the effectiveness of a learning function. But AL methods require constant supervision, as documents have to be labeled at each round of the process. In this paper, we propose that certain characteristics of unlabeled L2R datasets allow for an unsupervised, compression-based selection process to be used to create small and yet highly informative and effective initial sets that can later be labeled and used to bootstrap a L2R system. We implement our ideas through a novel unsupervised selective sampling method, which we call Cover, that has several advantages over AL methods tailored to L2R. First, it does not need an initial labeled seed set and can select documents from scratch. Second, selected documents do not need to be labeled as the iterations of the method progress since it is unsupervised (i.e., no learning model needs to be updated). Thus, an arbitrarily sized training set can be selected without human intervention depending on the available budget. Third, the method is efficient and can be run on unlabeled collections containing millions of query-document instances. We run various experiments with two important L2R benchmarking collections to show that the proposed method allows for the creation of small, yet very effective training sets. It achieves full training-like performance with less than 10% of the original sets selected, outperforming the baselines in both effectiveness and scalability.

AB  - Regional Tourism Performance Evaluation (RTPE) is an important way for local governments to measure the results of regional tourism development, the study of which is of great significance in ensuring the correct choice of tourism development path. Focusing on the interrelationship between tourism and the regional economy, society and ecological environment, this paper places tourism in a regional context and constructs an RTPE indicator system from the systems theory perspective, where regional tourism performance expectations is calculated through fuzzy hierarchical analysis. Then a stable and accurate RTPE model is established with the powerful learning function of radial basis neural networks. In the following, the model is tested with Ordos City from Inner Mogolia as an example, and the main influencing factors of its tourism development performance are determined with the importance ranking of the indicators, which show that the tourism in Ordos falls into a gradual decrease now and even a sharp decline in some particular years after a period of rapid development. Based on the analysis of the importance ranking of indicators, it is found that the improvement of tourism performance should be promoted by the following ways: Strengthening the investment in science and technology and making efforts to attract more talents, further developing the tertiary industry and improving the tertiary industry chain, expanding overseas markets and increasing tourism foreign exchange earnings as a breakthrough. The conclusions of the evaluation are in line with the reality and the accuracy of the model is validated. Filtering the influencing factors by ranking the importance of the indicators can help the local government to identify and solve the current problems, so as to improve tourism development.

AB  - This paper combines near infrared spectroscopy with deep learning theory to propose a rapid identification method for compound fertilizer based on gramian angular field (GAF) image coding and quaternion convolutional neural network (QCNN). First, the near-infrared (NIR) spectra of 200 samples of two types of compound with and without polyglutamic acid (& gamma;-PGA) were collected and pretreated by multivariate scattering correction (MSC) and first derivative methods. Then, the one-dimensional (1D) NIR spectra were transformed into twodimensional (2D) images by GAF coding method to express the spectral information more intuitively. Finally, three images of Gramian angular difference field (GADF), Gramian angular summation field (GASF) and their average images were formed into a pure quaternion matrix for parallel representation and were analyzed by the designed QCNN. The peak features and minor features were mined based on the automatic learning function of multi-layer structure of QCNN to establish a high-performance, qualitative model for identifying compound fertilizer. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the identification model were 95.84%, 95.96% and 94.25%, respectively. Compared with the classification results based on traditional partial least square discrimination analysis(PLS-DA), principal component analysis combing with support vector machine classification(PCA-SVM), 1D convolution neural network (1DCNN) and GAF-CNN methods, the classification accuracy and adaptability of the model based on the proposed GAF-QCNN method have been significantly improved. The combination of GAF image of NIR spectra and QCNN developed in this study provides a novel approach for the intelligent modeling algorithm of NIR spectroscopy technology.

AB  - Introduction: As one of the most commonly used anesthetics, isoflurane has been demonstrated to possess a variety of protective effects. However, its' neurological impaired effect should be considered during clinical application. Roles of lncRNA BDNF-AS (BDNF-AS) and miR-214-3p in isoflurane-injured microglia and rats were investigated in this study, aim- ing to disclose the mechanism of isoflurane damage and to provide candidate therapeutic targets. Material and methods: Isoflurane-induced microglia cells and rat models were established with 1.5% isoflurane. Inflam- mation and oxidative stress of microglia cells were evaluated with a level of pro-inflammation cytokines, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and nitrite. Cognitive and learning function of rats were assessed with Morris water maze task. Expressions of BDNF-AS and miR-214-3p and their function in the isoflurane-induced microglia cells and rats were estimated with PCR and corresponding transfection.Results: Isoflurane induced significant neuro-inflammation and oxidative stress in the microglia cells. The increased BDNF- AS and the decreased miR-214-3p were noted, and BDNF-AS was found to negatively regulate miR-214-3p in the isoflu- rane-induced microglia cells. Isoflurane caused cognitive dysfunction in rats, and resulted in a significant inflammatory response. The knockdown of BDNF-AS significantly alleviated the neurological impairment induced by isoflurane, which was reversed by silencing miR-214-3p.Conclusions: In isoflurane-induced neuro-inflammation and cognitive dysfunction, BDNF-AS showed a significant protec- tive effect on the neurological impairment induced by isoflurane through modulating miR-214-3p.

AB  - The ever-increasing complexity of numerical models and associated computational demands have challenged classical reliability analysis methods. Surrogate model-based reliability analysis techniques, and in particular those using kriging meta-model, have gained considerable attention recently for their ability to achieve high accuracy and computational efficiency. However, existing stopping criteria, which are used to terminate the training of surrogate models, do not directly relate to the error in estimated failure probabilities. This limitation can lead to high computational demands because of unnecessary calls to costly performance functions (e.g., involving finite element models) or potentially inaccurate estimates of failure probability due to premature termination of the training process. Here, we propose the error-based stopping criterion (ESC) to address these limitations. First, it is shown that the total number of wrong sign estimation of the performance function for candidate design samples by kriging, S, follows a Poisson binomial distribution. This finding is subsequently used to estimate the lower and upper bounds of S for a given confidence level for sets of candidate design samples classified by kriging as safe and unsafe. An upper bound of error of the estimated failure probability is subsequently derived according to the probabilistic properties of Poisson binomial distribution. The proposed upper bound is implemented in the kriging-based reliability analysis method as the stopping criterion. The efficiency and robustness of ESC are investigated here using five benchmark reliability analysis problems. Results indicate that the proposed method achieves the set accuracy target and substantially reduces the computational demand, in some cases by over 50%.

AB  - Sleep deprivation (SD) is known to impair learning and memory function of animals. Physical exercise can alleviate SD-related functional defecit. This study observed the effect of physical exercise on memory or learning function plus expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in rats under different SD paradigms, in order to investigate the potential effect of exercise on SD rats and related mechanisms. Male adult SD rats were assigned into control, 24 h SD, 36 h SD and 48 h SD groups, each of which was sub-divided into naive or 6-week exercise groups (N = 10 each). SD model was generated by small platform localization. Learning score was evaluated by Y-maze. Serum superoxide peroxidase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, acetylcholine esterase (AchE) and 5-HT levels were measured by colorimetry. BDNF expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) was quantified by immunohistochemistry (IHC). All SD groups showed lower Y-maze scores, plus decreased SOD and BDNF levels, and higher MDA, AchE and 5-HT levels, all of which were correlated with time series (P < 0.05). Compared to naive animals, exercised rats had improved Y-maze scores, higher SOD or BDNF expression, and lower MDA, AchE or 5-HT levels, with potentiated effects of elongated exercise time (P < 0.05). SD aggravated brain function and impaired memory or learning. Exercise improved SD effects of rat's learning and memory functions, possibly involving up-regulation of BDNF protein, anti-oxidation or neurotransmitter mediation. Such protective effects were facilitated with elongated treatment time.

AB  - Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are used with high efficiency in wastewater treatment due to the formation of hydroxyl radicals with high oxidation capacity. However, there exists many different variables which affect the efficiency of theses processes as it affects the amount of hydroxyl radicals formed; such as reaction time, pH, temperature, reactant concentrations and catalyst amount. In this study, the removal of 2-chlorophenol (2-CP) and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP), which are highly toxic organic pollutants, with Fenton oxidation was investigated. This research has two aims. The first is modelling of substituted phenols removing with AOPs utilizing artificial neural networks (ANN), and the second is determination of the relative important among the input parameters for removing. In the research, 18 different ANN structures were used. The best ANN model for prediction of 2-CP and chemical oxygen demand from 2-CP (COD2-CP) were determined at the ANN10 structure. In this structure, 15 neurons, Levenberg-Marquardt and logarithmic sigmoid-symmetric sigmoid were used as learning and transfer functions, respectively. In addition, at the ANN16 and ANN2 structures, which were used for the prediction of removing efficiency for 2,4-DCP and COD2,4-DCP, have obtained better results. In both models, Levenberg-Marquardt learning function was used. In ANN16, transfer functions were logarithmic sigmoid-symmetric sigmoid with 20 neurons and, in ANN2, symmetric sigmoid-symmetric sigmoid transfer functions with 10 neurons. When examined the sensitivity analysis results, all the input parameters have a significant effect on the substituted phenols removing with AOPs.

AB  - The development of sepsis in patient suffering from traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a frequent complication that has been associated with worsened global and neurological outcome. In an effort to better characterize the influence of sepsis following TBI, we developed an in vivo model of combined TBI and sepsis in the rat by coupling two validated models: (1) Controlled Cortical Impact (CCI) and (2) Cecal Ligation and Puncture (CLP). Possible contributing effects of sepsis on post-traumatic outcome were evaluated as mortality rate, body weight change, neurological motor (beam balance), cognitive (Morris water maze [MWM] for memory and learning) function, histopathological damage (lesion volume, cell counts in the CA1 and CA3 hippocampal areas), and morphological indices of inflammation (activated microglia and astrocytes) for the 14-day study period. In this study, we produced a mild TBI characterized by a low mortality rate, a transient delay in weight gain, and a transient impairment in motor and cognitive functions. The histological counterpart was represented by a cortical lesion in the area of impact at 14 days post-injury, associated with cell loss in the CA1 and CA3 hippocampal regions, and scarce infiltration of microglia. The superimposition of sepsis on this mild TBI model resulted in worsening of post-injury mortality and weight loss, significant exacerbation of post-injury motor deficit and cognitive impairments, and further exacerbation of neuronal cell death in the CA3 area together with over-expression and activation of microglial cells in the peri-lesional area. Altogether, our findings indicate that sepsis, when superimposed on TBI, exerts a negative effect on the evolution of post-traumatic damage.

AB  - The accurate demand prediction with high efficiency and advanced demand-side controller are essential for the enhancement of energy flexibility provided by buildings, whereas the current literature fails to present the mechanism on modelling development and demand-side control. This paper aims to deal with the complexity of building demand prediction with supervised machine learning method, including the multiple linear regression, the support vector regression and the backpropagation neural network. The regularization, adding the sum of the weights to the learning function, is utilized to improve the training speed and to solve the overfitting by eliminating the unnecessary connections with small weights. The configuration of the artificial neural network was presented, and sensitivity analysis has been conducted on the learning performance regarding different training times. Energy flexibilities of sophisticated building energy systems (including renewable system, electric and thermal demands and building services systems) were quantitatively characterised with a series of quantifiable indicators. Moreover, several advanced controllers have been developed and contrasted, in regard to the flexibility utilisation of building energy systems. Results showed that, the developed hybrid controller with short-term prediction through the cross-entropy function is more technically competitive than other controllers. With the implementation of the developed hybrid controller, the peak power of the grid importation can be reduced from 500.3 to 195 kW by 61%. This study formulates a data-driven model with an advanced machine learning algorithm for the accurate building demand prediction and a hybrid advanced controller with shortterm prediction for the energy management, which are critical for the promotion of energy flexible buildings.

AB  - This study explores the possibility of utilizing green butanol, a promising type of biofuel, in diesel engines to measure its impact on engine performance and emissions. Experimental data were collected on several param-eters, including brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC), brake thermal efficiency (BTE), exhaust gas tempera-ture, all of which are influenced by the biofuel type used, in this case, butanol. The study examined emissions such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and smoke opacity. Such emissions have the potential to improve with the use of different biofuels ratios, such as butanol. Advanced machine learning techniques, Elman and Cascade Neural Networks, were employed to predict the performance and emission characteristics of engines using butanol. The models were trained using a Conjugate Gradient Learning Function with Polak-Ribie`re Restarts to simulate the effects of butanol as biofuel, on diesel engines. Key findings revealed that when incorporating butanol into diesel fuel blends, potential improvements in BTE and fuel effi-ciency were observed. Notably, using butanol as a biofuel reduced exhaust gas temperatures and CO emissions, demonstrating the potential of this particular biofuel. Conversely, there were observed increases in HC emissions and smoke opacity, signifying the complexities of using biofuels such as butanol. Cascade neural network proved to be highly accurate in predicting engine performance parameters fueled with butanol as biofuel. Overall, the study offers valuable insights into the use of butanol as a biofuel, its potential benefits, and challenges, under-scoring the importance of continuous research in sustainable biofuels such as butanol.

AB  - Imprecise probabilities have gained increasing popularity for quantitatively modeling uncertainty under incomplete information in various fields. However, it is still a computationally challenging task to propagate imprecise probabilities because a double-loop procedure is usually involved. In this contribution, a fully decoupled method, termed as active learning-augmented probabilistic integration (ALAPI), is developed to efficiently estimate the failure probability function (FPF) in the presence of imprecise probabilities. Specially, the parameterized probability-box models are of specific concern. By interpreting the failure probability integral from a Bayesian probabilistic integration perspective, the discretization error can be regarded as a kind of epistemic uncertainty, allowing it to be properly quantified and propagated through computational pipelines. Accordingly, an active learning probabilistic integration (ALPI) method is developed for failure probability estimation, in which a new learning function and a new stopping criterion associated with the upper bound of the posterior variance and coefficient of variation are proposed. Based on the idea of constructing an augmented uncertainty space, an imprecise augmented stochastic simulation (IASS) method is devised by using the random sampling high-dimensional representation model (RS-HDMR) for estimating the FPF in a pointwise stochastic simulation manner. To further improve the efficiency of IASS, the ALAPI is formed by an elegant combination of the ALPI and IASS, allowing the RS-HDMR component functions of the FPF to be properly inferred. Three benchmark examples are investigated to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. (c) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) chips undergo several types of stress in the field, including thermal, electrical, and humidity stress. Existing work has concentrated primarily on humidity and thermal stress; there has been relatively little emphasis on voltage stress level prediction. The objectives of this investigation were to (1) explore the impact of voltage stress on SRAM functionality, (2) observe heating rate differences under voltage stress over time, (3) predict stress levels using artificial neural network models, and (4) develop a generic methodology for voltage stress prediction. A 62256 SRAM CMOS based chip located on an 8051 programming board was studied. Preliminary experiments suggest that as voltage and/or stress time increases, chip temperature increases as well. In addition, the combination of both factors causes the chip to fail within minutes of stress. Artificial neural network models with 3-2-1 and 3-3-1 topologies were constructed to predict stress level given heating rate over time. Thermal profiles of both the entire chip and the die area only were used for neural network model development and evaluation. Results indicate (1) high-voltage stress shortens the lifecycle of SRAM chips, (2) heating rate increases are relatively great in the first few minutes, then reach a steady state, and (3) the neural network model can predict stress level with good accuracy. Using data from the die area yielded the lowest average error rate (3.6%) and using data from the entire chip yielded a 10% error rate. In addition, the trainRP learning function resulted in a lower error rate than other learning functions such as trainGD and trainCGP.

AB  - The problem of locating a contour widely exists in the engineering product design, such as the constrained optimization problem, reliability analysis, and so on. The surrogate model-assisted contour prediction methods have gained more attention lately because they can alleviate the computational burden significantly compared with the traditional simulation-based approaches. Representatively, the method built on the expected improvement (EI) infill criterion can allocate a contour from expensive simulations by refining the Kriging model with high-fidelity (HF) samples sequentially. Recently, the multi-fidelity (MF) Kriging model has gained remarkable attention because it integrates the accurate but costly HF model and cheap but biased low-fidelity (LF) model to provide an accurate prediction of the original black-box system. To facilitate the usage of the MF Kriging model in the contour prediction, a novel sequential multi-fidelity surrogate model-assisted contour prediction method is developed in this work. First, an extended expected improvement (EEI) infill criterion is developed to overcome the shortcoming of the original EI criterion on determining the locations and fidelity level of new samples. The developed EEI criterion can quantify the improvement of a sample from different fidelities over the contour of interest by considering the relative correlation between different fidelities. Second, considering the significant effect of the high-to-low simulation cost ratio on the MF Kriging model, the proposed approach selects an HF sample or several LF samples with equivalent computational resources to refine the MF Kriging model in each cycle according to their total improvements to the contour of interest. To this end, the EEI criterion is further revised combining a parallel strategy to generate the LF samples. The performance of the proposed approach is tested on three numerical examples with different complexities and an engineering case. The results show that the proposed approach has better efficiency, prediction accuracy, and robust performance compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - This work aims to synthesize akaganeite nanoparticles (AKNPs) by using microwave and use them to adsorb Congo red dye (CR) from the aqueous solution. The AKNPs with an average particle size of about 50 nm in width and 100 nm in length could be fabricated in 20 min. The effects of pH, CR initial concentration, adsorption time, and adsorbent dosage on the adsorption process were investigated and the artificial neural network (ANN) was used to analyze the adsorption data. The various ANN structures were examined in training the data to find the optimal model. The structure with training function, TRAINLM; adaptation learning function, LARNGDM; transfer function, LOGSIG (in hidden layer) and PURELIN (in output layer); and 10 neutrons in hidden layer having the highest correlation (R-2 = 0.996) and the lowest MSE (4.405) is the optimal ANN structure. The consistency between the experimental data and the data predicted by the ANN model showed that the behavior of the adsorption process of CR onto AKNPs under different conditions can be estimated by the ANN model. The adsorption kinetics was studied by fitting the data into pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, Elovich, and intraparticle diffusion models. The results showed that the adsorption kinetics obeyed the pseudo-second-order model and governed by several steps. The adsorption isotherms at the different temperatures were studied by fitting the data to Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin isotherm models. The R-2 obtained from the Langmuir model was above 0.9 and the highest value in three of four temperatures, suggesting that the adsorption isotherms were the best fit to the Langmuir model and the maximum adsorption capacity was estimated to be more than 150 mg/g. Thermodynamic studies suggested that the adsorption of CR onto AKNPs was a spontaneous and endothermic process and physicochemical adsorption. The obtained results indicated the potential application of microwave-synthesize AKNPs for removing organic dyes from aqueous solutions.

AB  - Automatic guided vehicles have become an important part of transporting goods in dynamic environments, and how to design an efficient path planning method for multiple AGVs is a current research hotspot. Due to the complex road conditions in dynamic environments, there may be dynamic obstacles and situations in which only the target point is known but a complete map is lacking, which leads to poor path planning and long planning time for multiple automatic guided vehicles (AGVs). In this paper, a two-level path planning method (referred to as GA-KL, genetic KL method) for multi-AGVs is proposed by integrating the scheduling policy into global path planning and combining the global path planning algorithm and local path planning algorithm. First, for local path planning, we propose an improved Q-learning path optimization algorithm (K-L, Kohonen Q-learning algorithm) based on a Kohonen network, which can avoid dynamic obstacles and complete autonomous path finding using the autonomous learning function of the Q-learning algorithm. Then, we adopt the idea of combining global and local planning by combining the K-L algorithm with the improved genetic algorithm; in addition, we integrate the scheduling policy into global path planning, which can continuously adjust the scheduling policy of multi-AGVs according to changes in the dynamic environment. Finally, through simulation and field experiments, we verified that the K-L algorithm can accomplish autonomous path finding; compared with the traditional path planning algorithm, the algorithm achieved improves results in path length and convergence time with various maps; the convergence time of the algorithm was reduced by about 6.3%, on average, and the path length was reduced by about 4.6%, on average. The experiments also show that the GA-KL method has satisfactory global search capability and can effectively avoid dynamic obstacles. The final experiments also demonstrated that the GA-KL method reduced the total path completion time by an average of 12.6% and the total path length by an average of 8.4% in narrow working environments or highly congested situations, which considerably improved the efficiency of the multi-AGVs.

AB  - In engineering applications, an important challenge of structural reliability analysis is to minimize the number of calls to the performance function, which is expensive to evaluate. In recent years, metamodels have been introduced to solve this problem and the methods combining the Kriging model and Monte Carlo simulation have widely gained attention, because they sample training points sequentially. Two essential issues should be considered in these kinds of methods: the selection of the next training point and the stopping criterion of the iteration. EGRA (efficient global reliability analysis) and AK-MCS (active learning reliability method combining Kriging and Monte Carlo simulation) are two representative approaches, whose strategy of sampling training points and stopping criterion are based on evaluations of each Monte Carlo sample under certain learning functions. However, these proposed learning functions are based on the individual performance of each Monte Carlo sample, causing the methods to focus more on the local optimization. As a result, the idea of globally solving the problem was proposed and applied to the GSAS method in 2015. In this paper, a new global reliability analysis method is proposed. Unlike GSAS, a new learning function called the uncertainty reduction quantification function (UROF) is put forward. Specifically, a new random variable proposed in GSAS that helps simplify the statistical feature of Monte Carlo samples is inherited from GSAS, and a weighting function that establishes the connection between any point and the next training point is proposed. These two functions are combined to build UROF, which quantifies the uncertainty reduction of predicted failure probability after a new training point is added. Meanwhile, a novel stopping criterion is proposed by calculating a prediction of an upper bound of failure probability's relative error; the iteration stops when this prediction reaches a preset bound. In the end, a series of examples are performed, which indicates that both UROF and the novel stopping criterion can improve the efficiency of the method, more or less.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a significant public health challenge, increasingly affecting patients' finances, mental health, and functional abilities as the global population ages. Stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (SC-EVs) have emerged as a promising cell-free therapeutic approach for AD, although their precise mechanisms remain unclear. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effectiveness of SC-EVs in treating AD. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases up to December 31, 2023, identifying studies investigating SC-EVs therapy in AD rodent models. Outcome measures included Morris water maze and Y maze tests, beta-amyloid pathology, and inflammatory markers. Statistical analyses utilized Stata 15.1 and R software. Results: This meta-analysis of 16 studies (2017-2023, 314 animals) demonstrates significant efficacy of SC-EVs therapy in AD models. Pooled analyses demonstrated that SC-EVs therapy significantly increased the learning function as measured by Morris water maze tests (MWM) by -1.83 (95% CI = -2.51 to -1.15, p < 0.0001), Y maze test by 1.66 (95% CI = 1.03 to 2.28, p < 0.0001), decreased A beta plaques in the hippocampal by -2.10 (95% CI = -2.96 to -1.23, p < 0.0001), and proinflammatory cytokines Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) by -2.61 (95% CI = -4.87 to -0.35, p < 0.05), Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) by -2.37 (95% CI = -3.68 to -1.05, p < 0.001). Conclusions: SC-EVs therapy shows promise in enhancing cognitive function and mitigating AD progression in preclinical models. Future research should focus on standardizing methodologies and comparing SC-EVs isolation techniques and dosing strategies to facilitate clinical translation.

AB  - "Web-to-Print" has become a new trend of printing industry all over the world recently. It combines the advantages of internet with printing processes in a highly digitalized way, and has been used in the U.S. and Europe for a while. Nowadays in the 21st century, whether offset printing, gravure printing, flexo printing, screen printing or digital printing cannot survive without interne, and it will be the trend for printers to develop Web-to-Print platform to reduce cost and increase productivity. Most of Asian printers still use traditional processes to print orders. Comparing to the printers in the U.S. or European countries, these printers in Asia seem not so active in the development of Web-to-Print. Under the influence of digitalization, it will be very important for them to consider how to provide "Web-to-Print" services. To begin with, this research conduct case study analyses of major successful stories of Web-to-Print by literature and actual examples. Functionalities of profitable web-to-print platform, based on our findings, may include various basic on-line operations such as on-line editing, on-line proofing and on-line ordering. Besides, in order to offer a user-friendly environment for foreign customers, the platform should take bilingual user interface into account. The platform should also provide copyright management and on-line legal advice service. After basic functionalities are implemented, educational service such as knowledge learning function are included to illustrate basic and professional printing knowledge which will be useful for those customers who are not familiar with print processes. The results of this study should help traditional printers invest on web-to-print business and provide a good reference for future studies related web-to-print technology and services.

AB  - Mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS II) is caused by a deficiency of iduronate-2-sulfatase that results in accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG), including heparan sulfate (HS), which is considered to contribute to neuropathology. We examined the efficacy of intracerebroventricular (ICV) enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) of idursulfase-beta (IDS-) and evaluated the usefulness of HS as a biomarker for neuropathology in MPS II mice. We first examined the efficacy of three different doses (3, 10, and 30 g) of single ICV injections of IDS- in MPS II mice. After the single-injection study, its long-term efficacy was elucidated with 30 g of IDS- ICV injections repeated every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. The efficacy was assessed by the HS content in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the brain of the animals along with histologic examinations and behavioral tests. In the single-injection study, the 30 g of IDS- ICV injection showed significant reductions of HS content in brain and CSF that were maintained for 28 days. Furthermore, HS content in CSF was significantly correlated with HS content in brain. In the long-term repeated-injection study, the HS content in the brain and CSF was also significantly reduced and correlated. The histologic examinations showed a reduction in lysosomal storage. A significant improvement in memory/learning function was observed in open-field and fear-conditioning tests. ICV ERT with 30 g of IDS- produced significant improvements in biochemical, histological, and functional parameters in MPS II mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that the HS in the CSF had significant positive correlation with brain tissue HS and GAG levels, suggesting HS in CSF as a useful clinical biomarker for neuropathology.

AB  - Based on piezoelectric ceramics' piezoelectric effect, a new type of piezoelectric ceramic friction damper (PCFD) is designed and manufactured to provide a reliable energy dissipation device for structural response control. In the PCFD, high-strength bolts limit the deformation of piezoelectric ceramics under voltage, and the resulting reaction force changes the preload of high-strength bolts, thereby realizing real-time adjustment of friction by adjusting the positive pressure on the friction surface. The influence of friction plates with different materials on the hysteretic performance of friction damper under different tightening torque is investigated by cyclic loading test to determine the friction plate's selection in the PCFD. The hysteretic performance test is carried out to evaluate the energy dissipation capacity of PCFD with different voltages, and the experimental results are compared with the theoretical values. The finite element model of PCFD is established to analyze the stress distribution of each component of the PCFD under different voltages. Based on the semi-active control characteristics of PCFD, the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy neural network semi-active control system for frame structure with PCFD is designed. The adaptive learning function of the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is used to generate fuzzy rules and fuzzy neural network controller (FNNC). Finally, the semi-active control simulation of three-storey frame structure model under seismic excitation is carried out by Simulink. The experimental and numerical results show that the PCFD designed in this paper has good energy dissipation capacity, and the maximum control force increases linearly with the increase of voltage. The combination of FNNC, which is established by ANFIS, and PCFD can effectively reduce the structure response.

AB  - Associating DVB-T2 and Scalable Video Coding (SVC) constitutes an efficient way for broadcasting added-value video services, such as HDTV and 3D TV, to end-users. The ultimate objective of this new approach of broadcasting video services is to ensure high Quality of Experience (QoE) for end users. Whilst Quality of Service (QoS) is the collective effect of performance that determines the degree of satisfaction of a user of a service, QoE reflects more accurately the user experience, as it is based on human perception when evaluating the video quality. Maximizing user QoE is thus becoming a crucial requirement when deploying new broadcast platforms for the provisioning of high quality video services. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. At first, we introduce a reference-less QoE measurement tool dedicated to SVC coding. Based on a learning function, this tool is able to learn the non-linear relationship between parameters affecting video quality and perceived user QoE. According to several experiments carried out using this tool, we demonstrate that decoding all SVC layers is not always efficient to achieve high user QoE, mostly when SVC enhanced layers experience packet losses. For the sake of maintaining a good QoE, it is worthwhile withdrawing enhanced layers experiencing packet losses and not displaying them to end-users. Based on this observation, we propose a QoE-Based Adaptive SVC Decoding (QoE-BASD) algorithm that assists a video receiver to select the appropriate SVC layers for video decoding in order to maximize QoE. We evaluate the performance of the proposed solution: (i) analytically, by using discrete Markov Chains to model the proposed solution; and (ii) via OPNET-based computer simulations. The obtained results are encouraging, and illustrate the gain achieved by QoE-BASD when compared to the conventional approach.

AB  - This study was conducted to study lycopene efficacy in brain-behavior, pro-inflammatory and apoptotic markers, and antioxidant levels in a rodent model. Rats were administered with propionic acid (PPA) (500 mg/kg BW) to induce autism-like disorders, then treated with different lycopene (L) concentrations (5, 10, 20 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) for 35 days. The groups were: (i);control, (ii);PPA, (iii);PPA + L5, (iv);PPA + L10, and (v);PPA + L20. In this study, serum and brain malondialdehyde (MDA) levels decreased with lycopene supplements compared to the PPA group, similarly to the brain levels of inflammatory factors (IL-1 alpha, IL-8, NF-kappa B, TNF-alpha; p < .05). Besides, brain levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 decreased, whereas pro-apoptotic Bax, antioxidant Nrf2, and HO-1 levels in brain increased compared with PPA (p < .05). This study showed that lycopene might have therapeutic value to improve the dysfunctions in learning and memory in a dose-dependent way, along with the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic molecular responses in a rat model of ASD-like disorders. Practical applications This study suggested that lycopene can reduce propionic acid (PPA)-induced learning and memory impairment and oxidative damage by participating in multiple biological activities such as antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. Lycopene protects serum and brain tissues against PPA induced oxidative damage in rats. These effects may be realized through up-regulation of the brain Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and down-regulation of the IL-1 alpha, IL-8, TNF-alpha, and NF-kappa B levels. Lycopene may also contribute to memory and learning function, apoptotic/antiapoptotic modulation, and antioxidant and possible therapeutic efficacy in PPA-induced- Autism spectrum disorder cases.

AB  - In this work, a bionic memristive circuit with the functions of emotional learning and generation is proposed, which can perform brain-like emotional learning and generation based on various types of input information. The proposed circuit is designed based on the brain emotional learning theory in the limbic system, which mainly includes three layers of design: 1) the bottom layer is the design of the basic unit modules, such as neuron and synapse; 2) the middle layer is the design of the functional modules related to emotional learning in the limbic system, such as the amygdala, thalamus, and so on; and 3) the top layer is the design of the overall circuit, which is used to realize the function of the emotional generation. A 2-D emotional space composed of valence and arousal signals is adopted. According to the above bottom-up circuit design method, the valence and arousal signals can be generated, respectively, by designing corresponding emotional learning circuits, so as to form continuous emotions. The volatile and nonvolatile memristors are mainly used to mimic the functions of the neuron and synapse at the bottom layer of the circuit to achieve the core emotional learning function of the middle layer, thereby constructing a brain-like information processing architecture to realize the function of the emotional generation in the top layer. The simulation results in PSPICE show that the proposed circuit can learn and generate emotions like humans. If the proposed circuit is applied to a humanoid robot platform through further research, the robot may have the ability of personalized emotional interaction with humans, so that it can be effectively used in emotional companionship and other aspects.

Sports Exerc., Vol. 44, No. 12, pp. 2362-2368, 2012. Introduction: Brain atrophy is associated with impairment in cognitive function and learning function. The aim of this study was to determine whether daily physical activity prevents age-related brain atrophy progression. Methods: The participants were 381 men and 393 women who had participated in both the baseline and the follow-up surveys (mean duration = 8.2 yr). Magnetic resonance imaging of the frontal and temporal lobes was performed at the time of the baseline and follow-up surveys. The daily physical activities and total energy expenditures of the participants were recorded at baseline with uniaxial accelerometry sensors. Multiple logistic regression models were fit to determine the association between activity energy expenditure, number of steps, and total energy expenditure variables and frontal and temporal lobe atrophy progression while controlling for possible confounders. Results: In male participants, the odds ratio of frontal lobe atrophy progression for the fifth quintile compared with the first quintile in activity energy expenditure was 3.408 (95% confidence interval = 1.205-9.643) and for the number of steps was 3.651 (95% confidence interval = 1.304-10.219). Men and women with low total energy expenditure were at risk for frontal lobe atrophy progression. There were no significant differences between temporal lobe atrophy progression and physical activity or total energy expenditure. Conclusion: The results indicate that physical activity and total energy expenditure are significant predictors of frontal lobe atrophy progression during an 8-yr period. Promoting participation in activities may be beneficial for attenuating age-related frontal lobe atrophy and for preventing dementia.

AB  - To what extent does the communication make a goal-oriented community efficient in different topologies? In order to gain insight into this problem, we study the influence of learning method as well as that of the topology of the environment on the communication efficiency of crawlers in quest of novel information in different topics on the Internet. Individual crawlers employ selective learning, function approximation-based reinforcement learning (RL), and their combination. Selective learning, in effect, modifies the starting URL lists of the crawlers, whilst RL alters the URL orderings. Real data have been collected from the web and scale-free worlds, scale-free small world (SFSW), and random world environments (RWEs) have been created by link reorganization. In our previous experiments [Zs. Palotai, Cs. Farkas, A. Lorinez, Is selection optimal in scale-free small worlds?, ComPlexUs 3 (2006) 158-168], the crawlers searched for novel, genuine documents and direct communication was not possible. Herein, our finding is reproduced: selective learning performs the best and RL the worst in SFSW, whereas the combined, i.e., selective learning coupled with RL is the best-by a slight margin-in scale-free worlds. This effect is demonstrated to be more pronounced when the crawlers search for different topic-specific documents: the relative performance of the combined learning algorithm improves in all worlds, i.e., in SFSW, in SFW, and in RWE. If the tasks are more complex and the work sharing is enforced by the environment then the combined learning algorithm becomes at least equal, even superior to both the selective and the RL algorithms in most cases, irrespective of the efficiency of communication. Furthermore, communication improves the performance by a large margin and adaptive communication is advantageous in the majority of the cases. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - When adaptively selecting training point in Kriging model based time-dependent reliability analysis, existing methods may lose efficiency due to less considering the Kriging prediction correlation at different time instant as well as the interaction of random input and time variable. Thus, a novel training point selection strategy is proposed by maximizing structural state misclassification probability (SSMP) reduction. Firstly, by taking the Kriging prediction correlation at different time instant into account, the SSMP is derived for random input candidate sample. Secondly, since it is inefficient to actually evaluate SSMP, the expected SSMP is approximately derived with the current Kriging model information by virtually adding the random input and time candidate sample pair into training set. Then, the SSMP reduction, i.e., the difference between the SSMP derived in first step and the expected SSMP in the second one, can be evaluated. By actually adding the random input and time candidate sample pair with the maximum SSMP reduction into training set, the novel training point selection strategy is proposed to update the Kriging model for minimizing SSMP expectedly. Due to considering the Kriging prediction correlation in deriving SSMP, as well as the interaction of random input and time in evaluation the SSMP reduction, the maximum SSMP reduction guided training point selection strategy is superior to the upto-date methods. The presented example results show that the proposed method needs a least number of evaluating performance function in four compared adaptive Kriging model based methods, and the reduction number of evaluating performance function of the proposed method with respect to the upto-date methods is more in complex engineering examples than in the simple numerical ones.

AB  - The present work reviews the implementation of adaptive metamodeling for reliability analysis with emphasis in four main types of metamodels: response surfaces, polynomial chaos expansions, support vector machines, and Kriging models. The discussion presented is motivated by the identified spread and little interaction between metamodeling techniques in reliability, which makes it challenging for practitioners to decide which one to consider in a context of implementation. The conceptual problem of reliability analysis and the theoretical description of the four models is presented, and complemented by a comparative discussion of applications with identification of new areas of interest. The different considerations that influence the efficiency of adaptive metamodeling are reviewed, with extension to applicability discussions for the four models researched. Despite all adaptive techniques contributing to achieve significant gains in the amount of effort required for reliability analysis, and with minimal trade-off in accuracy, they should not be expected to perform equally in regard to the dependence on the reliability problem being addressed.
   Cross application of methodologies, bridging the gap between methodology and application, and ensembles are some of new areas of research interest identified. One of the major critical considerations for adaptive metamodeling, and that has been target of limited research, is the need for comprehensive techniques that allow a blind selection of the most adequate model with relation to the problem in-hand.
   To conclude, the extensive and comprehensive discussion presented aims to be a first step for the unification of the field of adaptive metamodeling in reliability; so that future implementations do not exclusively follow individual lines of research that progressively become more narrow in scope, but also seek transversal developments in the field of adaptive metamodeling for reliability analysis.

AB  - Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. The calcium-dependent protease, calpain, has been shown to be involved in TBI-induced neuronal death. However, whereas various calpain inhibitors have been tested in several animal models of TBI, there has not been any clinical trial testing the efficacy of calpain inhibitors in human TBI. One important reason for this could be the lack of knowledge regarding the differential functions of the two major calpain isoforms in the brain, calpain-1 and calpain-2. In this study, we used the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model in mice to test the roles of calpain-1 and calpain-2 in TBI-induced neuronal death. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) with calpain activity markers performed at different time-points after CCI in wild-type and calpain-1 knock-out (KO) mice showed that calpain-1 was activated early in cortical areas surrounding the impact, within 0-8h after CCI, whereas calpain-2 activation was delayed and was predominant during 8-72h after CCI. Calpain-1 KO enhanced cell death, whereas calpain-2 activity correlated with the extent of cell death, suggesting that calpain-1 activation suppresses and calpain-2 activation promotes cell death following TBI. Systemic injection(s) of a calpain-2 selective inhibitor, NA101, at 1h or 4h after CCI significantly reduced calpain-2 activity and cell death around the impact site, reduced the lesion volume, and promoted motor and learning function recovery after TBI. Our data indicate that calpain-1 activity is neuroprotective and calpain-2 activity is neurodegenerative after TBI, and that a selective calpain-2 inhibitor can reduce TBI-induced cell death.

AB  - Although perinatal exposure of female rats to estrogenic compounds produces irreversible changes in brain function, it is still unclear how the amount and timing of exposure to those substances affect learning function, or if exposure alters estrogen receptor a (ER alpha) expression in the hippocampus and cortex. In adult female rats, we investigated the effects of neonatal exposure to a model estrogenic compound, ethinyl estradiol (EE), on passive avoidance learning and ER alpha expression. Female Wistar-Imamichi rats were subcutaneously injected with oil, 0.02 mg/kg EE, 2 mg/kg EE, or 20 mg/kg 17 beta-estradiol within 24 h after birth. All females were tested for passive avoidance learning at the age of 6 weeks. Neonatal 0.02 mg/kg EE administration significantly disrupted passive avoidance compared with oil treatment in gonadally intact females. In a second experiment, another set of experimental females, treated as described above, was ovariectomized under pentobarbital anesthesia at 10 weeks of age. At 15-17 weeks of age, half of each group received a subcutaneous injection of 5 mu g estradiol benzoate a day before the passive avoidance learning test. Passive avoidance learning behavior was impaired by the 0.02 mg/kg EE dose, but notably only in the estradiol benzoate-injected group. At 17-19 weeks of age, hippocampal and cortical samples were collected from rats with or without the 5 mu g estradiol benzoate injection, and western blots used to determine ER alpha expression. A significant decrease in ER alpha expression was observed in the hippocampus of the estradiol-injected, neonatal EE-treated females. The results demonstrated that exposure to EE immediately after birth decreased learning ability in adult female rats, and that this may be at least partly mediated by the decreased expression of ER alpha in the hippocampus.

AB  - Background: Traditional Chinese medicines exhibit promising preventive effects on Alzheimer's disease. Chaihu Shugan San (CSS) is a well-known traditional herbal formula whose several kinds of ingredients have the potential of ameliorating Alzheimer's disease. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of CSS on the microbiota-gut-brain axis and cognitive deficits of senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice as well as investigate the underlying mechanisms.
   Methods: Thirty 5-month-old SAMP8 mice were randomly divided into the model group (SAMP8), CSS low-dose treatment group (CSSL), and CSS high-dose treatment group (CSSH). Ten SAMR1 mice were used as the normal control, and ten SAMP8 mice treated with donepezil were used as the positive control of cognitive function. CSS was orally administrated to SAMP8 mice for 8 weeks. The Morris water maze test was used to evaluate cognitive function. Histological staining was used to observe neuronal injury and A ss deposition. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the synaptic ultrastructure. 16S rRNA gene analysis was performed to measure the changes in intestinal microbiota.
   Results: The results showed that CSS significantly improved the learning function and memory deficits of aged SAMP8 mice in the Morris water maze examination. CSS ameliorated neuronal injury, synaptic injuries, and A ss deposition in the brain of SAMP8 mice. In addition, CSS also significantly improved microbiota composition in terms of elevating Lactobacillus reuteri and decreasing Staphylococcus xylosus in the feces of aged SAMP8 mice.
   Conclusion: These findings suggested that CSS might have a preventive potential for cognitive deficits in aging through regulating gut microbiota, which paved the way for the application of CSS for prevention and therapeutic purposes for mild cognitive impairment as well as Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - A neuromorphic computing network based on SiCx memristor paves the way for a next-generation brain-like chip in the AI era. Up to date, the SiCx-based memristor devices are faced with the challenge of obtaining flexibility and uniformity, which can push forward the application of memristors in flexible electronics. For the first time, we report that a flexible artificial synaptic device based on a Ag NPs:a-SiC0.11:H memristor can be constructed by utilizing aluminum foil as the substrate. The device exhibits stable bipolar resistive switching characteristic even after bending 1000 times, displaying excellent flexibility and uniformity. Furthermore, an on/off ratio of approximately 10(7) can be obtained. It is found that the incorporation of silver nanoparticles significantly enhances the device's set and reset voltage uniformity by 76.2% and 69.7%, respectively, which is attributed to the contribution of the Ag nanoparticles. The local electric field of Ag nanoparticles can direct the formation and rupture of conductive filaments. The fitting results of I-V curves show that the carrier transport mechanism agrees with Poole-Frenkel (P-F) model in the high-resistance state, while the carrier transport follows Ohm's law in the low-resistance state. Based on the multilevel storage characteristics of the Al/Ag NPs:a-SiC0.11:H/Al foil resistive switching device, we successfully observed the biological synaptic characteristics, including the long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). The flexible artificial Ag NPs:a-SiC0.11:H/Al foil synapse possesses excellent conductance modulation capabilities and visual learning function, demonstrating the promise of application in flexible electronics technology for high-efficiency neuromorphic computing in the AI period.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease(AD) is a globally prevalent neurodegenerative disease, clinically characterized by progressive memory loss and gradual impairment of cognitive functions. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation has been considered a possible therapeutic method for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, no quantitative data synthesis of MSC therapy for AD exists. We conducted asystematic review and meta-analysis to study the effects of MSCs on cognitive deficits in animal models of AD.
   Methods: We identified eligible studies published from January 1980 to January 2017 by searching four electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CNKI). The endpoint was the effects of MSCs on cognitive performance evaluated by the Morris water maze (MWM) test including escape latency, and/or number of platform crossing, and/or time in the target quadrant.
   Results: Nine preclinical studies incorporating 225 animals with AD were included for the meta-analysis. The studies indicated that MSC-based treatment significantly improved the learning function through measurements of the escape latency (SMD = -0.99, 95% CI = -1.33 to -0.64, p < .00001). Additionally, we observed that transplantation of MSCs significantly increased the number of platform crossing in six experiments (SMD = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.43 to 1.13, p < .0001). What's more, the times in the target quadrant were increased in five studies indicated that transplantation of MSCs could ameliorate the cognitive impairments (SMD = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.46 to 1.67, p = .0005).
   Conclusions: This study showed that MSC transplantation could reduce cognitive deficits in AD models. These findings support the further studies to translate MSCs in the treatment of AD in humans

AB  - Bed collapse is a serious problem in a fluid-bed granulation process of traditional Chinese medicine. Moisture content and size distribution are regarded as two pivotal influencing factors. Herein, a smart hyperspectral image analysis methodology was established via deep residual network (ResNet) algorithm, which was then applied to monitoring moisture content, size distribution and contents of four bioactive compounds of granules in the fluid -bed granulation process of Guanxinning tablets. First, a hyperspectral imaging camera was utilized to acquire hyperspectral images of 132 real granule samples in the spectral region of 389-1020 nm. Second, the moisture content and size distribution of the granules were measured with a laser particle sizer and a fast moisture analyzer, respectively. Moreover, the contents of danshensu, ferulic acid, rosmarinic acid and salvianolic acid B of the granules were determined by using high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection. Third, ResNet quantitative calibration models were built, which consisted of convolutional layer, maxpooling layer, four convolutional blocks with residual learning function and two fully connected layers. As a result, the R2c values for the moisture content, granule sizes and contents of four bioactive compounds are determined to be 0.957, 0.986, 0.936, 0.959, 0.937, 0.938, 0.956, 0.889, 0.914 and 0.928, whereas the R2p values are calculated as 0.940, 0.969, 0.904, 0.930, 0.925, 0.928, 0.896, 0.849, 0.844, and 0.905, respectively. The predicted values matched well with the measured values. These findings indicated that ResNet algorithm driven hyperspectral image analysis is feasible for monitoring both the physical and chemical properties of Guanxinning tablets at the same time.

AB  - Radio links in wireless body area networks (WBANs) commonly experience highly time-varying attenuation due to the dynamic network topology and frequent occlusions caused by body movements, making it challenging to design a reliable, energy-efficient, and real-time communication protocol for WBANs. In this article, we present Chimp, a learning-based power-aware communication protocol in which each sending node can self-learn the channel quality and choose the best transmission power level to reduce energy consumption and interference range while still guaranteeing high communication reliability. Chimp is designed based on learning automata that uses only the acknowledgment packets and motion data from a local gyroscope sensor to infer the real-time channel status. We design a new cost function that takes into account the energy consumption, communication reliability and interference and develop a new learning function that can guarantee to select the optimal transmission power level to minimize the cost function for any given channel quality. For highly dynamic postures such as walking and running, we exploit the correlation between channel quality and motion data generated by a gyroscope sensor to fastly estimate channel quality, eliminating the need to use expensive channel sampling procedures. We evaluate the performance of Chimp through experiments using TelosB motes equipped with the MPU-9250 motion sensor chip and compare it with the state-of-the-art protocols in different body postures. Experimental results demonstrate that Chimp outperforms existing schemes and works efficiently in most common body postures. In high-date-rate scenarios, it achieves almost the same performance as the optimal power assignment scheme in which the optimal power level for each transmission is calculated based on the collected channel measurements in an off-line manner.

AB  - Classification is used for discovery of a predictive learning function that classifies data item into one of several predefined classes. e.g., classify universities based on students number or based on offered programs, or classify cars based on gas mileage, and Presentation it by decision-tree, classification rule, neural network, and genetic algorithms, etc.
   It is noted that, there are large amount of data obtained from the universities. We need to evaluate the accurate assessment of the performance of any institution. Currently the decision in ministry of higher education and scientific research is taken randomly, not based on logical analysis. Moreover, the education towards to universal, the ministry of higher education in Yemen has to activate the council of accreditation, and support it to start quickly and effectively. In this paper, we have used approach to assist the council for accreditation to start automation for accreditation operations and mechanisms, that's proposed by using machine learning techniques, also to help decision makers for taking accurate and swift decisions. Our study is used to classify institution that wants to take a license from council to three classes: grant license of accreditation, grand license provided to improvement has done, or not granting accreditation license. We have used the intelligent algorithms for calculate probability of grand accreditation license based on degree of council standards, which we used to predict through a model building to classification by using Naive Bayes algorithm. The proposed method is typically for evaluation the new institution by depends on evaluation of existing institutions. We experiment the proposed framework by flexible parameters and attributes with private training dataset, that's carefully generated and tested using real life applications. In addition, we implemented our proposed approach as a program.

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine the long-term effects of prenatal and early-life WIFI signal exposure on neurodevelopment and behaviors as well as biochemical alterations of Wistar rats. On the first day of pregnancy (E0), expectant rats were allocated into two groups: the control group (n = 12) and the WiFi-exposed group (WiFi group, n = 12). WiFi group was exposed to turn on WiFi for 24 h/day from E0 to postnatal day (PND) 42. The control group was exposed to turn-off WiFi at the same time. On PND7-42, we evaluated the development and behavior of the offspring, including body weight, pain threshold, and swimming ability, spatial learning, and memory among others. Also, levels of proteins involved in apoptosis were analyzed histologically in the hippocampus in response to oxidative stress. The results showed that WiFi signal exposure in utero and early life (1) increased the body weight of WiFi + M (WiFi + male) group; (2) no change in neuro-behavioral development was observed in WiFi group; (3) increased learning and memory function in WiFi + M group; (4) enhanced comparative levels of BDNF and p-CREB proteins in the hippocampus of WiFi + M group; (5) no neuronal loss or degeneration was detected, and neuronal numbers in hippocampal CA1 were no evidently differences in each group; (6) no change in the apoptosis-related proteins (caspase-3 and Bax) levels; and (7) no difference in GSH-PX and SOD activities in the hippocampus. Prenatal WiFi exposure has no effects on hippocampal CA1 neurons, oxidative equilibrium in brain, and neurodevelopment of rats. Some effects of prenatal WiFi exposure are sex dependent. Prenatal WiFi exposure increased the body weight, improved the spatial memory and learning function, and induced behavioral hyperactivity of male rats.

AB  - This paper presents a model of learning by the cerebellar circuit. In the traditional and dominant learning model, training teaches finely graded parallel fibre synaptic weights which modify transmission to Purkinje cells and to interneurons that inhibit Purkinje cells. Following training, input in a learned pattern drives a training-modified response. The function is that the naive response to input rates is displaced by a learned one, trained under external supervision. In the proposed model, there is no weight-controlled graduated balance of excitation and inhibition of Purkinje cells. Instead, the balance has two functional states-a switch-at synaptic, whole cell and microzone level. The paper is in two parts. The first is a detailed physiological argument for the synaptic learning function. The second uses the function in a computational simulation of pattern memory. Against expectation, this generates a predictable outcome from input chaos (real-world variables). Training always forces synaptic weights away from the middle and towards the limits of the range, causing them to polarise, so that transmission is either robust or blocked. All conditions teach the same outcome, such that all learned patterns receive the same, rather than a bespoke, effect on transmission. In this model, the function of learning is gating-that is, to select patterns that trigger output merely, and not to modify output. The outcome is memory-operated gate activation which operates a two-state balance of weight-controlled transmission. Group activity of parallel fibres also simultaneously contains a second code contained in collective rates, which varies independently of the pattern code. A two-state response to the pattern code allows faithful, and graduated, control of Purkinje cell firing by the rate code, at gated times.

KW  - STROKE
AB  - Stroke is a common cerebrovascular disease that threatens human health, and the search for therapeutic drugs is the key to treatment. New drug discovery was driven by many accidental factors in the early stage. With the deepening of research, disease-related target discovery and computer-aided drug design constitute a more rational drug discovery process. The deep learning model was constructed by using recurrent neural network, and then, the classification and prediction of compound-protein interactions were studied. In this study, the network pharmacological prediction of stroke based on deep learning is obtained. (1) In the case of discrete time, a distributed optimization algorithm with finite time convergence is applied. A distributed exact first-order algorithm for the case where the objective function is smooth. On the basis of the DGD algorithm, an additional cumulative correction term is added to correct the error caused by the fixed step size of DGD. Solve multiple optimization problems with equality constraints by using Lagrangian functions. Alternately update the original variable and the dual variable to get the solution of a large global problem. It converges to the optimal solution in an asymptotic or exponential way; that is, the node can reach the optimal solution more accurately when the time tends to infinity. (2) Deep learning, also sometimes called representation learning, has a set of algorithms that can automatically discover the desired classification or detection by feeding it into a machine using raw datasets. Multiple levels of abstraction are abstracted through the use of nonlinear models. This simplifies finding solutions to complex and nonlinear functions. Based on the automatic learning function, it provides the functions of modularization and transfer learning. Deep architectures, which usually contain hidden layers, differ from traditional machine learning, which requires a large amount of data to train the network. There are many levels of modules that are nonlinear and transform the information present on the first level into higher levels which are more abstract in nature and are basically used for feature extraction and transformation. (3) The accuracy rate of the framework based on the multitask deep learning algorithm is 91.73%, and the recall rate reaches 96.13%. The final model was predicted and analyzed using real sample data. In the inference problem, it has the advantages of fast training and low cost; in the generation problem, it also has the advantages of fast training, high stability, high diversity, and high quality of image reconstruction.

AB  - Background: With the dramatic growth in smartphones, mobile health applications (apps) in the field of healthcare or medicine, which are characterized by strong operability, flexibility and interactivity, provide a supplementary approach to medical learning. The aims of this study were to awaken medical students to pay more attention to the learning function of mobile health app and gain deeper insight into our understanding of the factors influencing medical students' mobile health apps continuance intention for enhancing practical utilization.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with a self-designed questionnaire administered to medical students at Chongqing Medical University. Data were collected from 450 participants from March to April 2019. SPSS V.25 was used for the descriptive statistical analysis of the results. Smart PLS 3.2.7 was used to construct a structural equation modelling framework to estimate the influencing factors of medical students' continuance intention to use mobile health apps.
   Results: The external characteristics of mobile health apps had a positive influence on perceived ease of use (beta = 0.378, P < 0.001). Perceived ease of use had a positive impact on perceived usefulness (beta = 0.573, P < 0.001). Perceived ease of use (beta = 0.195, P = 0.011), perceived usefulness (beta = 0.450, P < 0.001) and subjective norms (beta = 0.255, P < 0.001) had a positive impact on attitude towards using mobile health apps. Additionally, perceived usefulness 03 = 0.202, P < 0.001) and attitude (beta = 0.730, P < 0.001) had a remarkable influence on continuance intention. Furthermore, the mediating effect of attitude between perceived usefulness and continuance intention was significant (beta = 0.329, P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Both perceived usefulness and attitude have a significant effect on medical students' mobile health apps continuance intention. So, we suggest apps providers and developers evoking and maintaining users' interest in mobile health apps and perfecting apps' features from various aspect. Also, more attention should be paid on social relationship to introduce medical students to familiarize mobile health apps and strengthen adhesiveness of medical students.

TI  - Effects of mild intrauterine hypoperfusion in the second trimester on memory and learning function in rat offspring
T2  - NEURAL REGENERATION RESEARCH
KW  - STEM-CELL PROLIFERATION
KW  - MODEL
AB  - Mild intrauterine hypoperfusion (MIUH) is a serious pathological event that affects the growth and development of fetuses and offspring. MIUH can lead to growth restriction, low birth weight, neurodevelopmental disorders, and other adverse clinical outcomes. To study the effects of MIUH on learning and memory function in offspring, a model of MIUH was established by placing a coil (length 2.5 mm, diameter 0.24 mm) on the uterine artery and ovarian uterine artery of Sprague-Dawley rats in the second trimester of pregnancy (day 17). Next, 120 mg/kg lithium chloride (the MIUH + Li group) or normal saline (the MIUH group) was injected intraperitoneally into these rats. In addition, 120 mg/kg lithium chloride (the Li group) or normal saline (the SHAM group) was injected intraperitoneally into pregnant rats without coil placement. The Morris water maze was used to detect changes in learning and memory ability in the offspring at 4 weeks after birth. In the MIUH group, the escape latency and journey length before reaching the platform were both increased, and the number of times that the platform was crossed and the activity time in the target quadrant within 90 seconds were both decreased compared with the SHAM group. Immunofluorescence double staining and western blot assays demonstrated that hippocampal nestin and Ki67 (both cell-proliferation-related proteins) expression was significantly downregulated in the MIUH group compared with the SHAM group. Furthermore, western blot assays were conducted to investigate changes in related signaling pathway proteins in the brains of offspring rats, and revealed that glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta) expression was upregulated and beta -catenin expression was downregulated in the MIUH group compared with the SHAM group. In addition, compared with the MIUH group, the expression levels of p-GSK3 beta and beta -catenin were upregulated in the MIUH + Li group. These results suggest that MIUH may affect learning and memory function in rat offspring by regulating the GSK3 beta signaling pathway. The experimental procedures were approved by Animal Ethics Committee of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University (approval No. 2018PS07K) in June 2018.

AB  - The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) is established to find the geographic origins of Chinese wolfberry quickly. In the paper, the 45 samples of Chinese wolfberry from different places of Qinghai Province are to be surveyed by FTIR. The original data matrix of FTIR is pretreated with common preprocessing and wavelet transform. Compared with common windows shifting smoothing preprocessing, standard normal variation correction and multiplicative scatter correction, wavelet transform is an effective spectrum data preprocessing method. Before establishing model through the artificial neural networks, the spectra variables are compressed by means of the wavelet transformation so as to enhance the training speed of the artificial neural networks,, and at the same time the related parameters of the artificial neural networks model are also discussed in detail. The survey shows even if the infrared spectroscopy data is compressed to 1/8 of its original data, the spectral information and analytical accuracy are not deteriorated. The compressed spectra variables are used for modeling parameters of the back propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) model and the geographic origins of Chinese wolfberry are used for parameters of export. Three layers of neural network model are built to predict the 10 unknown samples by using the MATLAB neural network toolbox design error back propagation network. The number of hidden layer neurons is 5, and the number of output layer neuron is 1. The transfer function of hidden layer is tansig, while the transfer function of output layer is purelin. Network training function is trainl and the learning function of weights and thresholds is learngdm net. trainParam. epochs=1 000, while net. trainParam. goal=0. 001. The recognition rate of 100% is to be achieved. It can be concluded that the method is quite suitable for the quick discrimination of producing areas of Chinese wolfberry. The infrared spectral analysis technology combined with the artificial neural networks is proved to be a reliable and new method for the identification of the original place of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

AB  - In order to provide theoretical support for high-quality construction of Sichuan-Tibet railway project, the construction risk level of Sichuan-Tibet railway project should be evaluated scientifically and reasonably. This paper analyses the characteristics of bridge and tunnel construction projects in view of the five super-large bridges and nine super-long tunnels in the construction of Sichuan-Tibet railway, constructing seventeen safety risk evaluation index systems for bridge engineering and twenty safety risk evaluation index systems for tunnel engineering, establishing the risk assessment model to complete the risk assessment of key bridges and tunnels of Sichuan-Tibet railway. Finally, the BP neural network model is constructed to validate the results of risk assessment. This BP network model has three layers, the maximum number of training times is 10,000, the hidden layer neurons are 15, the hidden layer activation function is Tansig function, the output layer activation function is logig function, the training function is trainlm function, and the learning function is learngdm function. The training data are scoring data of some key bridges and some key tunnels of Sichuan-Tibet railway, and the remaining scoring results are used as validation data, to predict the risk level of bridge and tunnel engineering. The results show that the accuracy of predicting the safety risk grade of bridge and tunnel engineering by BP neural network is 92.86% BP neural network is applicable to the risk assessment model. 50% of the key bridge and tunnel projects of Sichuan-Tibet railway are in danger, and only 20% of the projects are in safety grade. Therefore, it is suggested that construction units pay attention to the safety supervision of construction personnel, strict control of the quality of construction equipment and materials. For different possible accidents, relevant units should start emergency plans as soon as possible, take safety protection measures, avoid continuous operation of cold and anoxia as far as possible, minimize the time of frequent geological activities, and further analyze the hidden dangers of construction risks. To reduce or even eliminate risk sources fundamentally.

AB  - Aripiprazole (APZ) is regarded as a first-line atypical antipsychotic used for the treatment of first and multiple episodes of schizophrenia to improve positive- and negative-symptoms. Its therapeutic indications were extended to acute manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder. In addition, APZ was approved as an adjunct therapy for major depressive disorder in 2007. Compared to other antipsychotic drugs. APZ has a unique pharmacological profile. It is a partial agonist at D-2 dopamine receptors and serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptors, whereas it is an antagonist at serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT6 receptors. Since epilepsy is often accompanied with neurological comorbidities such as depression, anxiety and cognitive deficits caused by both the disease and/or drug treatment, we wished to examine the effects of a sub-chronic treatment (>14 consecutive days) with APZ (0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg; i.p.) on both absence seizures and WAG/Rij rat's behavior using different standard paradigms: Open field (OF) test, elevated plus maze (EPM) test, forced swimming (FS) test, sucrose consumption (SC) test and Morris water maze (MWM). WAG/Rij rats represent a validated genetic animal model of absence epilepsy with mild-depression comorbidity, also including other behavioral alterations. APZ treatment showed some anti-absence properties and regarding the behavioral comorbidity in this rat strain, we observed that APZ possesses clear antidepressant effects in the FS and SC tests also increasing memory/learning function in the Morris water maze test. In the two anxiety models used, APZ showed only minor effects. In conclusion, our results indicate that APZ might actually have a potential in treating absence seizures or as add-on therapy but more interestingly, these effect might be accompanied by positive modulatory actions on depression, anxiety and memory which might be also beneficial in other epileptic syndromes.

AB  - Background and Objectives Serum creatinine is typically used to assess kidney function. Impaired kidney function and thus high serumcreatinine increase the risk of poor cognitive performance. However, serum creatinine might have a nonlinear association because low serumcreatinine has been linked to cardiovascular risk and impaired cognitive performance. We studied the longitudinal association between serum creatinine and cognitive performance in midlife.
   Methods Since 2001, participants from the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study were followed up for 10 years. Serum creatinine was measured repeatedly in 2001, 2007, and 2011. Sex-specific longitudinal trajectories for serum creatinine among participants without kidney disease were identified with latent class growth mixture modeling. Overall cognitive function and 4 specific domains-working memory, episodic memory and associative learning, reaction time, and information processing-were assessed with a computerized cognitive test.
   Results Four serum creatinine trajectory groups with clinically normal serum creatinine were identified for bothmen (n = 973) and women (n = 1,204). After 10 years of follow-up, cognitive testing was performed for 2,026 participants 34 to 49 years of age (mean age 41.8 years). In men and women, consistently low serum creatinine was associated with poor childhood school performance, low adulthood education, low adulthood annual income, low physical activity, and smoking. Compared to the men in the low serum creatinine trajectory group, those in the high serumcreatinine group had better overall cognitive performance (ss = 0.353 SD, 95% CI 0.022-0.684) and working memory (ss = 0.351 SD, 95% CI 0.034-0.668), while those in the moderate (ss = 0.247 SD, 95% CI 0.026-0.468) or normal (ss = 0.244 SD, 95% CI 0.008-0.481) serum creatinine groups had better episodic memory and associative learning. No associations were found for women.
   Discussion Our results indicate that in men, compared to low serum creatinine levels, consistently high levels may be associated with better memory and learning function in midlife.

AB  - The integration of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system, known as ANFIS, is investigated for simulating the hydrodynamic in a bubble column reactor. The Eulerian-Eulerian two-phase model is employed as the CFD approach. For the ANFIS technique, a sensitivity analysis is done by varying the number of inputs and the number of membership functions (MFs). The x and z coordinates of the fluid location, the air velocity, and the pressure are considered as the inputs of the ANFIS, while the air vorticity is the output. The results revealed that the ANFIS with all four inputs and the MFs of five achieved the highest intelligence with the regression number close to 1. More specifically, gbell function in the learning framework is used to train all local computing nodes from solving Navier-Stokes equations. In the decision or prediction part, the fuzzy mechanism is used for the prediction of extra nodes that solve, which Navier-Stokes equations did not solve. The results show that the gbell function enables us to fully train all numerical points and also store data set in the frame of mathematical equations. Besides, this function responds well with the number of inputs and MFs for accurate prediction of reactor hydrodynamics. Additionally, a high number of MFs and input parameters influence the accuracy of the method during prediction. In the current study, gbell MF was studied to investigate its accuracy in the prediction of the two-phase flow. Also, different numbers of MFs were considered to investigate the level of accuracy and capability of prediction. ANFIS clustering methods, grid partition and fuzzy C-mean (FCM) clustering, are compared to see the ability of the method in prediction. To compare the accuracy of the ANFIS method with FCM clustering, the data were compared to the gaussmf function. The results showed that the method has high accuracy and that it could predict the flow pattern.

AB  - This paper presents a novel active learning method developed in the framework of epsilon-insensitive support vector regression (SVR) for the solution of regression problems with small size initial training data. The proposed active learning method selects iteratively the most informative as well as representative unlabeled samples to be included in the training set by jointly evaluating three criteria: (i) relevancy, (ii) diversity, and (iii) density of samples. All three criteria are implemented according to the SVR properties and are applied in two clustering-based consecutive steps. In the first step, a novel measure to select the most relevant samples that have high probability to be located either outside or on the boundary of the epsilon-tube of SVR is defined. To this end, initially a clustering method is applied to all unlabeled samples together with the training samples that are inside the epsilon-tube (those that are not support vectors, i.e., non-SVs); then the clusters with non-SVs are eliminated. The unlabeled samples in the remaining clusters are considered as the most relevant patterns. In the second step, a novel measure to select diverse samples among the relevant patterns from the high density regions in the feature space is defined to better model the SVR learning function. To this end, initially clusters with the highest density of samples are chosen to identify the highest density regions in the feature space. Then, the sample from each selected cluster that is associated with the portion of feature space having the highest density (i.e., the most representative of the underlying distribution of samples contained in the related cluster) is selected to be included in the training set. In this way diverse samples taken from high density regions are efficiently identified. Experimental results obtained on four different data sets show the robustness of the proposed technique particularly when a small-size initial training set are available. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In engineering problems, reliability assessment is often computationally expensive. Surrogate models with active learning approaches are commonly used to solve this problem. Kriging is one of the most popular surrogate models used in this domain. Recently, artificial neural networks (ANN) have also attracted a lot of interest for structural reliability assessment due to their powerful capability. Many active learning approaches have been developed based on Kriging models and ANN. But selecting an appropriate model or technique for a reliability assessment problem with limited knowledge of the limit state function remains a challenging task. Ensemble of surrogates seems to be a good approach to tackle this challenge. In this work, two active learning approaches are proposed to combine Kriging and ANN models for reliability analysis. One is the local best surrogate (LBS) approach and the other is the local weighted average surrogate (LWAS) approach. Cross-validation and Jackknife techniques are used to estimate prediction errors of the surrogate models. In addition, two methods are proposed to locally measure the goodness of the surrogate models and calculate the prediction errors of the ensemble of surrogates. The surrogate models are updated by selecting the new sample points that have large prediction errors and are close to the limit state. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approaches are demonstrated by 4 representative examples and two finite element problems. The results show that the proposed methods can be effective in evaluating the reliability of high dimension and rare event problems with less computational costs than the single typical surrogate model with active learning approaches (e.g. AK-MCS). Moreover, compared with the ensemble of surrogate models based on global goodness measurement, the proposed approaches also outperform in most cases. Finally, it should be mentioned that the proposed approaches are not only suitable for the combination of Kriging and ANN but also can be extended to other multiple surrogate models including support vector machine, polynomial chaos expansion, and so on.

AB  - Context2,4,6,8,10, 12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10, 12-hexazepane (CL-20) is a new energetic material with high performance and low sensitivity. In-depth study of the thermal decomposition mechanism of CL-20 is a necessary condition to improve its performance, ensure its safety, and optimize its application. On the basis of a large number of empirical force fields used in molecular dynamics simulation in the past, the machine learning augmented first-principles molecular dynamics method was used for the first time to simulate the thermal decomposition reaction of CL-20 at 2200 K, 2500 K, 2800 K, and 3000 K isothermal temperature. The main stable resulting compounds are N2, CO2, CO, H2O, andH2, where CO2 and H2O continue to decompose at higher temperatures. The initial decomposition pathways are denitration by N-N fracture, ring-opening by C-N bond fracture, and redox reaction involving NO2 and CL-20. After ring opening, two main compounds, fused tricyclic pyrazine and azadicyclic, were formed, which were decomposed continuously to form monocyclic pyrazine and pyrazole ring structures. The most common fragments formed during decomposition are those containing two, three, four, and six carbons. The formation rule and quantity of main small molecule intermediates and resulting stable products under different simulated temperatures were analyzed.MethodsBased on ab initio Bayesian active learning algorithm, efficient and accurate prediction of CL-20 is made using the dynamic machine learning function of Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Package (VASP), which constructs the energy potential surface by learning a large number of data based on AIMD calculations. The result is a machine learning force field (MLFF). Then the molecular dynamics of CL-20 was simulated using the trained MLFF model. PAW pseudopotentials and generalized gradient approximation (GGA), namely, Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional, are used in the calculation. The plane wave truncation energy (ENCUT) is set to 550 eV, and using the Gaussian broadening, the thermal broadening size of the single-electron orbital is 0.05 eV. A van der Waals revision of the system with Grimme Version 3. The energy convergence accuracy (EDIFF) of electron self-consistent iteration is set to 1E-5 eV and 1E-6 eV, respectively. The two-step structure optimization is carried out using 1 ' 1 ' 1 k point grid and conjugate gradient method. The ENCUT was changed to 500 eV and EDIFF to 1E-5 eV, and NVT integration (ISIF = 2) of Langevin thermostat was used for machine learning force field training and AIMD simulation of the system.

AB  - The pivotal problem in reliability analysis is how to use a smaller number of model evaluations to get more accurate failure probabilities. To achieve this aim, an iterative method based on the Monte Carlo simulation and the adaptive Kriging (AK) model (abbreviated as AK-MCS) has been proposed in 2011 by Echard et al. But for small failure probability, the number of the candidate points is extremely large for convergent solution. These points need to be evaluated by the current Kriging model to select the best next sample for updating the Kriging model in AK-MCS method, and the large candidate points will make the adaptive updating process of Kriging model much more time-consuming. Therefore, to improve the applicability of the AK-MCS method for small failure probability, the adaptive radial-based importance sampling (ARBIS) is employed to reduce the number of candidate points in the AK-MCS method, and an ARBIS combined with AK model method (abbreviated as AK-ARBIS) is proposed. The idea of the ARBIS is adaptively to find the optimal -sphere, i.e., the largest sphere of the safe domain, and then samples inside the optimal -sphere is directly recognized as safety and do not need to call the true limit state function to judge their states (safe or failed). During the adaptive process of finding the optimal -sphere, the Kriging model is ceaselessly updated layer after layer based on the U learning scheme in each sampling pool which only contains the samples between the current spherical rings. The updating process of Kriging model stops until the optimal -sphere is adaptively found and the convergent condition is satisfied. By finding the optimal -sphere, the total number of candidate samples is reduced which only includes the samples outside the optimal -sphere. Besides, the whole candidate sampling pool is partitioned into several sub-candidate sampling pool sequentially. The proposed method not only inherits the advantage of the AK-MCS but also reduces the reliability analysis time of the AK-MCS from two aspects. One is the size reduction of the candidate sampling pool, the other is the reduction of the actual limit state function evaluations because the sampling points locating inside the adaptively searched optimal -sphere do not need to participate in the training process. By analyzing a highly nonlinear numerical case, a non-linear oscillator system, a simplified wing box structural model, an aero-engine turbine disk and a planar ten-bar structure, the effectiveness and the accuracy of the proposed AK-ARBIS method for estimating the small failure probability are verified.

AB  - Objective As the basic physical quantity of classical mechanics and quantum mechanics, orbital angular momentum (OAM) is a natural characteristic of the spiral phase beams and has been widely studied in modern times. Meanwhile, the OAM states of different topological charges are orthogonal to each other, which can be employed as a new degree of freedom of information. Thus, OAM state has been applied to a variety of multiplexing communication systems, and the OAM state correction is the key to realize these multiplexing communication systems.
   We propose a high-precision OAM state correction method based on a diffractive deep neural network (D2NN) because D2NN has almost zero energy deep learning function, and is faster and more accurate than that of the traditional deep learning network, CNN. As D2NN can realize various complex functions in traditional computer neural networks and perform parallel operations at the speed of light, the proposed method will provide a high-speed and efficient OAM state correction for realizing large-capacity and high-quality for the next-generation wireless communication.
   Methods We study a D2NN-based OAM correction method. First, the D2NN component is obtained mainly through the training dataset composed of multiple sets of OAM states and the target OAM states under different turbulence interference. Second, the designed D2NN network components are trained, and the parameters in the components are updated and optimized until the square error loss function of the OAM state and the target OAM state output from the D2NN component reaches a predetermined threshold. Then, the D2NN component is obtained, and can achieve the wavefront correction with high-speed and high-precision. The influence of the training parameters and the network iteration times on the proposed correction method is discussed, and the number of D2NN network layers and the training parameters with the best performance are presented. Finally, after the physically D2NN diffractive component is fabricated, using techniques such as 3D printing or lithography, one can perform the specific task by adopting only optical diffraction components.
   Results and Discussions We propose a fast and efficient OAM state correction method based on D2NN to significantly reduce the training time and the loss function compared with the correction method based on the traditional CNNs. Furthermore, the environment configuration required by D2NN is not high and can be widely utilized. Meanwhile, we adjust the number of diffraction layers, the training parameters, and the network iterations in the designed D2NN to find the best correction performance. Additionally, the training parameters, with only amplitude as parameters, only phase as parameters, and both the phase and amplitude as parameters are discussed. The results show that the D2NN-based correction method performs optimally under medium turbulence (atmospheric turbulence intensity of 10(-14) m-2/3), with 8 diffraction layers (Table 4), and both the amplitude and phase used as the training parameters. As the number of network iterations increases, the loss function value in the proposed correction method will gradually decrease and converge to a constant (Figs. 8 and 9). In addition, the influence of the topological charge of the OAM state in the dataset on the correction effect is also studied. The comparison of the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the corrected OAM state shows that a smaller topological charge leads to a smaller distortion degree and a higher accuracy, with the PSNR greater than 30. This indicates that the OAM state has been corrected to be close to the original OAM state (Fig. 7).
   Conclusions The selection of iteration times, layers, and training parameters in the designed D2NN component will affect the correction speed and accuracy, and the high- precision OAM state correction can be realized through the designed D2NN component. When the atmospheric turbulence intensity is 10(-14) m(-2/3), the designed D2NN component has the best performance when the layer number is 8, and the phase and amplitude are adopted as the parameters. Meanwhile, the loss function is reduced by more than 45. 45% compared with those of the D2NN compoent when the layer number is 5. For the strong atmospheric turbulence, the correction accuracy can be improved by increasing the iteration number during the network training, since the reduction rate of the loss function in 20 iterations reaches 98. 03%. For weak turbulence, only phase parameters can be employed for training. For strong turbulence, the method combining the phase and the amplitude parameters is better in training. In addition, a smaller topological charge leads to a smaller corrected distortion. The proposed method has a fast and efficient learning function to provide a new implementation method for OAM state correction.

AB  - Objective: Many population studies have shown that maternal prenatal nutrition deficiency may increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in their offspring, but its potential transcriptomic effects on brain development are not clear. We aimed to investigate the transcriptional regulatory interactions between genes in particular pathways responding to the prenatal nutritional deficiency and to explore their effects on neurodevelopment and related disorders.
   Results: We identified three modules in rat hippocampus responding to maternal prenatal nutritional deficiency and found 15 key genes (Hmgn1, Ssbp1, LOC684988, Rpl23, Gga1, Rhobtb2, Dhcr24, Atg9a, Dlgap3, Grm5, Scn2b, Furin, Sh3kbp1, Ubqln1, and Unc13a) related to the rat hippocampus developmental dysregulation, of which Hmgn1, Rhobtb2 and Unc13a related to autism, and Dlgap3, Grm5, Furin and Ubqln1 are related to Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. Transcriptional alterations of the hub genes were confirmed except for Atg9a. Additionally, through modeling miRNA-mRNA-transcription factor interactions for the hub genes, we confirmed a transcription factor, Cebpa, is essential to regulate the expression of Rhobtb2.
   We did not find significant signals in the prefrontal cortex responding to maternal prenatal nutritional deficiency.
   Conclusion: These findings demonstrated that these genes with the three modules in rat hippocampus involved in synaptic development, neuronal projection, cognitive function, and learning function are significantly enriched hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and suggest that three genetic regulatory subnetworks and thirteen key regulating genes in rat hippocampus perturbed by a prenatal nutrition deficiency. These genes and related subnetworks may be prenatally involved in the etiologies of major brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, autism, and schizophrenia.
   Methods: We compared the transcriptomic differences in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex between 10 rats with prenatal nutritional deficiency and 10 rats with prenatal normal chow feeding by differential analysis and co-expression network analysis. A network-driven integrative analysis with microRNAs and transcription factors was performed to define significant modules and hub genes responding to prenatal nutritional deficiency. Meanwhile, the module preservation test was conducted between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Expression levels of the hub genes were further validated with a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction based on additional 40 pairs of rats.

AB  - Purpose: Learning impairment after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is common. Ketamine, an anesthetic used for ECT, has been demonstrated to attenuate cognitive impairment after ECT. However, the mechanism by which ketamine occurs in this case is still unknown. We aimed to explore the role of ketamine metabolite (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine [(2R,6R)-HNK] in the protection against learning impairment and investigate whether autophagy is involved in the protective effect. Materials and Methods: A rat depression model received electroconvulsive shock (ECS; simulated ECT in animal models) daily for 3 days. The Morris water maze was used to assess the spatial learning function of the rats. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of Beclin-1, light chain (LC)3-II/LC3-I, p62, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and p-mTOR in the hippocampus. Results: The escape latency for the maze in the ECS group was significantly longer than that in the sham ECS group (P=0.042). Meanwhile, the escape latency in the (2R,6R)-HNK+ECS group was significantly shorter than that in the ECS group (P=0.005). The LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and Beclin-1 expression level significantly increased, and the p62 expression level significantly decreased in the ECS group, compared with those in the sham ECS group (all P<0.001). The (2R,6R)-HNK+ECS group showed lower LC3-II/LC3-I ratio (P<0.001) and Beclin-1 expression level (P<0.001) and higher p62 (P<0.001) and p-mTOR expression levels (P=0.048) than did the ECS group. After small-molecule enhancer of rapamycin 28 (SMER28) administration, the role of (2R,6R)-HNK in protecting against learning impairment and inhibiting autophagy was abrogated, showing no difference in the escape latency; the difference in the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and p62 expression level between the SMER28 +(2R,6R)-HNK+ECS and ECS groups was not as significant as that between the (2R,6R)HNK+ECS and ECS groups (P<0.05-0.01 vs P<0.001). Conclusion: (2R,6R)-HNK yields cognitive protection by suppressing autophagy through the mTOR in the ECS-treated rat

AB  - There is a paucity of data on the effects of hyperoxia-induced brain damage on learning and such psychosocial phenomenon as anxiety. Preterm infants encounter hyperoxia within a relatively early stage of life (leaving the intrauterine environment earlier than was expected) and are exposed to high-level hyperoxic stress due to the insufficiency of their antioxidant defense mechanisms. In an experimental rat model, we investigated the effects of early postnatal hyperoxia on learning, anxiety, and depression in the early adulthood period. Rat nestlings (n = 7) were exposed to about 80% oxygen for the first 5 days after birth to create a rat model of hyperoxia, and these nestlings and those of the control group (n = 7) were subjected to behavioral tests (Morris water tank, open-field test, elevated plus maze, and Porsolt test) at 30 days old. Video recordings of the tests were captured, and indices of the tests in the experimental groups were compared with the Mann-Whitney U-test. In the Morris water navigation task, the latency and distance required to locate the platform were greater (P = 0.018 and 0.025, respectively) in the hyperoxia group than in the control group, suggesting that exposure to hyperoxia during the development of the brain can exert a negative effect on the learning function. There was no difference in the time spent in the open center area of the open-field test (anxiety), while the rats in the hyperoxia group spent more time in the enclosed area in the elevated plus maze test, suggesting a higher level of anxiety (P = 0.048). In the Porsolt test, rats in the hyperoxia group moved faster (P = 0.013) and travelled a longer distance (P = 0.048). Although this finding suggests less depressive behavior in the mentioned group, which was contrary to the expectations, this may also explain the tendency of preterm infants to hyperactivity at later ages. Thus, it has been demonstrated experimentally that exposure of neonates to oxygen exceeding physiological needs may cause behavioral problems, such as impaired learning, anxiety, and hyperactivity.

AB  - Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) triggers a set of complex inflammation that results in secondary injury. Parthenolide (PTN) is a sesquiterpene lactone extracted from the herb Tanacetum parthenium (Feverfew) and has potent anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptosis and anti-oxidative stress effects in the central nervous system (CNS)related diseases. This study focuses on investigating the potential neuroprotective effect of PTN on TBI and the related mechanism.
   Methods: Bv2 microglia, primary microglia were stimulated by LPS, and HT22 neuron cells were stimulated by OGD/R, and they were treated with different doses of PTN. The expression profiles of pro-inflammatory cytokines, proteins, oxidative stress mediators, STAT3/NF-kappa B pathway, inflammasomes were detected. Forty male/female C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into the sham, PTN, TBI, and TBI + PTN groups (10 mice per group). A mouse TBI model was set up with a controlled cortical impact (CCI) device. The modified nerve severity score (mNSS) was implemented to check short-term neurological impairment in mice, and the mice's memory and learning were assessed by the Morris water maze test. The water content in the mice's brains was measured by the dry-wet method. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, Nissl staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay were applied for neuronal apoptosis.
   Results: PTN dramatically alleviated LPS-induced inflammation in microglia, and OGD-mediated neuronal apoptosis and oxidative stress. In addition, PTN repressed LPS- or OGD-modulated STAT3/NF-kappa B and NLR family pyrin domain containing 1 (NLRP1), NLRP3, NLR family CARD domain containing 4 (NLRC4) inflammasomes activation. Administering the STAT3 inhibitor Stattic or NF-kappa B inhibitor Bay 11-7082 attenuated PTN-mediated effects. In vivo, PTN treatment relieved neural function deficits, brain edema and neuron apoptosis and improved the memory and learning function of TBI mice. Additionally, PTN impeded microglial activation and reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in brain lesions of TBI mice. Furthermore, PTN hindered STAT3/NF-kappa B and inflammasome activation.
   Conclusion: PTN can curb microglial activation and neuron apoptosis by dampening the STAT3/NF-kappa B pathway, thus exerting neuroprotective effects in TBI mice.

AB  - Accurate identification of protein function is critical to elucidate life mechanisms and design new drugs. We proposed a novel deep-learning method, ATGO, to predict Gene Ontology (GO) attributes of proteins through a triplet neural-network architecture embedded with pre-trained language models from protein sequences. The method was systematically tested on 1068 non-redundant benchmarking proteins and 3328 targets from the third Critical Assessment of Protein Function Annotation (CAFA) challenge. Experimental results showed that ATGO achieved a significant increase of the GO prediction accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art approaches in all aspects of molecular function, biological process, and cellular component. Detailed data analyses showed that the major advantage of ATGO lies in the utilization of pre-trained transformer language models which can extract discriminative functional pattern from the feature embeddings. Meanwhile, the proposed triplet network helps enhance the association of functional similarity with feature similarity in the sequence embedding space. In addition, it was found that the combination of the network scores with the complementary homology-based inferences could further improve the accuracy of the predicted models. These results demonstrated a new avenue for high-accuracy deep-learning function prediction that is applicable to large-scale protein function annotations from sequence alone.
   Author summary
   In the post-genome sequencing era, a major challenge in computational molecular biology is to annotate the biological functions of all genes and gene products, which have been classified, in the context of the widely used Gene Ontology (GO), into three aspects of molecular function, biological process, and cellular component. In this work, we proposed a new open-source deep-learning architecture, ATGO, to deduce GO terms of proteins from the primary amino acid sequence, through the integration of the triplet neural-network with pre-trained language models of protein sequences. Large benchmark tests showed that, when powered with transformer embeddings of the language model, ATGO achieved a significantly improved performance than other state-of-the-art approaches in all the GO aspect predictions. Following the rapid progress of self-attention neural network techniques, which have demonstrated remarkable impacts on natural language processing and multi-sensory data process, and most recently on protein structure prediction, this study showed the significant potential of attention transformer language models on protein function annotations.

AB  - The paper presents a new efficient and robust method for rare event probability estimation for computational models of an engineering product or a process returning categorical information only, for example, either success or failure. For such models, most of the methods designed for the estimation of failure probability, which use the numerical value of the outcome to compute gradients or to estimate the proximity to the failure surface, cannot be applied. Even if the performance function provides more than just binary output, the state of the system may be a non-smooth or even a discontinuous function defined in the domain of continuous input variables. This often happens because the mathematical model features non-smooth components or discontinuities (e.g., in the constitutive laws), bifurcations, or even domains in which no reasonable model response is obtained. In these cases, the classical gradient-based methods usually fail. We propose a simple yet efficient algorithm, which performs a sequential adaptive selection of points from the input domain of random variables to extend and refine a simple distance-based surrogate model. Two different tasks can be accomplished at any stage of sequential sampling: (i) estimation of the failure probability, and (ii) selection of the best possible candidate for the subsequent model evaluation if further improvement is necessary. The proposed criterion for selecting the next point for model evaluation maximizes the expected probability classified by using the candidate. Therefore, the perfect balance between global exploration and local exploitation is maintained automatically. If there are more rare events such as failure modes, the method can be generalized to estimate the probabilities of all these event types. Moreover, when the numerical value of model evaluation can be used to build a smooth surrogate, the algorithm can accommodate this information to increase the accuracy of the estimated probabilities. Lastly, we define a new simple yet general geometrical measure of the global sensitivity of the rare-event probability to individual variables, which is obtained as a by-product of the proposed refinement algorithm.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - BackgroundThe proteasome system plays an important role in synaptic plasticity. Induction and maintenance of long term potentiation is directly dependent on selective targeting of proteins for proteasomal degradation. The 20S proteasome activator PA28 activates hydrolysis of small nonubiquitinated peptides and possesses protective functions upon oxidative stress and proteinopathy. The effect of PA28 activity on behavior and memory function is, however, not known. We generated a mouse model that overexpresses PA28 (PA28OE) to understand PA28 function during healthy adult homeostasis via assessment of physiological and behavioral profiles, focusing on female mice.ResultsPA28 and PA28 protein levels were markedly increased in all PA28OE tissues analyzed. PA28OE displayed reduced depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test and improved memory/learning function assessed by intersession habituation in activity box and shuttle box passive avoidance test, with no significant differences in anxiety or general locomotor activity. Nor were there any differences found when compared to WT for body composition or immuno-profile. The cognitive effects of PA28OE were female specific, but could not be explained by alterations in estrogen serum levels or hippocampal regulation of estrogen receptor . Further, there were no differences in hippocampal protein expression of neuronal or synaptic markers between PA28OE and WT. Biochemical analysis of hippocampal extracts demonstrated that PA28 overexpression did not increase PA28-20S peptidase activity or decrease K48-polyubiquitin levels. Instead, PA28OE exhibited elevated efficiency in preventing aggregation in the hippocampus.ConclusionsThis study reveals, for the first time, a connection between PA28 and neuronal function. We found that PA28 overexpressing female mice displayed reduced depressive-like behavior and enhanced learning and memory. Since the positive effects of PA28 overexpression arose without an activation of 20S proteasome capacity, they are likely independent of PA28's role as a 20S proteasome activator and instead depend on a recognized chaperone-like function. These findings suggest that proteostasis in synaptic plasticity is more diverse than previously reported, and demonstrates a novel function of PA28 in the brain.

AB  - Intelligent metering technology combined with advanced numerical techniques enable a paradigm shift in the current level of water consumption information provision that is available to the customer and the water business. The aim of this study was to develop an autonomous and intelligent system for residential water end-use classification that could interface with customers and water business managers via a user-friendly web-based application. Water flow data collected directly from smart water meters includes both single (e.g., a shower event occurring alone) and combined (i.e., an event that comprises several overlapping single events) water end use events. The authors recently developed intelligent algorithms to solve the complex problem of autonomously categorising residential water consumption data into a registry of single and combined events using a hybrid combination of techniques including Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm, time-of-day probability functions, threshold values and various physical features. However, the issue still remained, which is the focus of this current paper, on how to integrate self-learning functionality into the visioned expert system, in order that it can learn from newly collected datasets from different cities, regions and countries, to that collected for the training data. Such versatility and adaptive capacity is essential to make the expert system widely applicable. Through applying alternate forms of HMM and DTW in association with a frequency analysis technique, a suitable self-learning methodology was formulated and tested on three independent households located in Melbourne, Australia with a prediction accuracy of between 80% and 90% for the major end-use categories. The three principle flow data processing modules (i.e., single and combined event recognition and self-learning function) were integrated into a prototype software application for performing autonomous water end-use analysis and its functionality is presented in the latter sections of this paper. The developed expert system has profound implications for government, water businesses and consumers, seeking to better manage precious urban water resources. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Soil spectral reflectance is the comprehensive representation of soil physical and chemical parameters, and its study is the physical basis for soil remote sensing and provides a new way and standard for soil properties themselves' research. Soil room spectra significantly correlate with that derived from hyperspectral images. So the room spectra are very important for soil taxonomy and investigation. To seek for the feasibility of soil taxonomy on the basis of topsoil reflectance spectral characteristics, and provide the theory foundation for quick soil taxonomy based on remote sensing methods, the spectral reflectance in the visible and near infrared region (400-2 500 nm) of 248 soil samples (black soil, chernozemrn, meadow soil, blown soil, alluvial soil) collected from Nongan county, Jilin province was measured with a hyperspectral device in room, and the soil spectral characteristics were determined with continuum removal method, and soil spectral indices (spectral absorption area, depth and asymmetry) were computed, which were introduced into BP network models as external input variables. The models consist of three layers (input, output and hidden layer), the training function is "'TRAINLM", learning function "LEARNGDM", and transferring function "TANSIG". The results showed that: (1) There are some differences among different soils in their spectral characteristics, but with similar parental matrix and climate, the spectral differences of soils in Nongan county are not significant. So it's difficult to analyze soil spectral characteristics based on soil reflectance. (2) The curves after continuum removal strengthened soil spectral absorption characteristics, and simplified soil spectral analysis. The soil spectral curves in Nongan county mainly have five spectral absorption vales at 494, 658, 1 415, 1 913 and 2 206 run, and the former two vales are caused by soil organic matter, Fe, and mechanical composition, the latter three are due to soil moisture; the differences of the latter three vales among different soils are not apparent, and the significant differences are in the former two vales region. (3) Soil reflectance is sensitive to organic matter, soil moisture Fe, mechanical composition, roughness, and so on. The sensitivity of soil spectral indices derived with continuum removing method is decreased. Then the models with these indices as input variables are more stable and general. As the input variables were external, the BP network model based on the former two vales' shape characteristics was better than that based on reflectance values or all five vales, the classifying accuracy of the main three soils (chernozem, meadow soil, blown soil) was bigger than 60%, and the model could be used for soil taxonomy. However, this work still needs further study, and to improve classifying accuracy, auxiliary data, such as topography, vegetation, and land use should be introduced.

AB  - Introduction In recent decades, artificial intelligence systems were employed for developing predictive models to estimate and predict many agriculture processes. Neural networks have the capability of identifying complex nonlinear systems with their own high learning ability. Artificial Neural Networks as a modern approach has successfully been used to solve an extensive variety of problems in the science and engineering, exclusively for some space where the conventional modeling procedure fail. A well-trained Artificial Neural Networks can be used as a predictive model for a special use, which is a data processing system inspired by biological neural system. The short storage life of hawthorn fruit and its high susceptibility to water loss and browning are the main factors limiting its marketability. So, it is important to evaluate parameters that affected the hawthorn quality. An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system or adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is a kind of artificial neural network that is based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system. To estimate changes in fruit quality as a function of storage conditions, the evolution of certain quality-indicative properties such as color, firmness or weight can be used to provide related information on the quality grade of the product stored. Measurement of these parameters is an expensive and time-consuming process. Therefore, parameter prediction due to affecting factors will be more useful. In this study, the physicochemical properties of hawthorn fruit during various storage was predicted using artificial neural networks method. Hawthorn (Crataegus pinnatifida), belonging to the Rosaceae family, consists of small trees and shrubs. The color of the ripe fruit ranges from yellow, through green to red, and on to dark purple. Hawthorn is one of the most widely consumed horticultural products, either in fresh or processed form. It is also an important component of many processed food products because of its excellent flavor, attractive color and high content of many macro-and micro-nutrients.Materials and Methods The purpose of this study was a prediction of color, physical and mechanical properties of hawthorn fruit (Crataegus pinnatifida) during storage condition using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and adaptive network based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Experimental data obtained from fruit storage, were used for training and testing the network. In the present research, artificial neural networks were used for modeling the relationship between physicochemical properties and color attributes with different storage time. Several criteria such as training algorithm, learning function, number of hidden layers, number of neurons in each hidden layer and activation function were given to improve the performance of the artificial neural networks. The total number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each hidden layer were chosen by trial and error. The network's inputs include storage time, hawthorn moisture content and storage temperature and the network's output were the values of the physicochemical and color properties. The training rules were Momentum and LevenbergMarquardt. The transfer functions were TanhAxon and SigmoidAxon.Results and Discussion To predict the weight loss and firmness multilayer perceptron network with the momentum learning algorithm, topologies of 3-15-5-1 and 3-8-5-1 with R2=0.9938 and 0.9953 were optimal arrangement, respectively. The optimal topologies for color change, hue, Chroma were 3-9-7-1 (R2=0.9421), 3-9-3-1 (R2=0.
   9947) and 3-7-1 (R2=0.9535) respectively, with momentum learning algorithm and TanhAxon activation function. The best network for ripening index prediction was Multilayer perceptron network with the TanhAxon activation function, Levenberg-Marquardt Levenberg-Marquardt learning algorithm, topology of 3-5-1-1 and R2=0.9956.Conclusions Three factors including firmness, total soluble solids and titratable acidity were considered for ripening index calculation during fruits storage condition. Momentum and Levenberg-Marquardt learning algorithms with SigmoidAxon and TanhAxon activation functions were used for training the patterns. Results indicated artificial neural networks to be accurate and versatile and they predicted the quality changes in hawthorn fruits. The outcomes of this study provide additional and useful information for hawthorn fruits storage conditions.

AB  - We present a novel approach to fault detection and Physical Asset Health Management (PAHM) called Logical Analysis of Data (LAD). LAD is a supervised learning, artificial intelligence, data mining technique that possesses distinctive advantages which proved to be of use in PAHM. This approach has been introduced by a group of researchers at Rutgers University in the USA, in the medical field, and it was adapted and used in the field of PAHM for the first time by our group of researchers. Unlike the traditional approaches that are either based on mathematical and statistical models or neural network modelling, this approach is based only on the advancement in the field of computer science, namely the speed of computation and the volume of data that can be processed, and proceeds in a logical manner like the human brain. That is why its potential for future applications seems promising. LAD does not assume that the data belong to a specific statistical distribution and therefore does not require statistical analysis of data prior to or after its use. Unlike the statistically based techniques, correlations and dependence between features or variables do not have any effect on LAD's performance. LAD can handle this phenomenon, and moreover, it gives physical explanation to it. Unlike other data analysis techniques, such as neural networks and support vector machines, LAD is a transparent method; the output of LAD can be traced back to the specific root causes that resulted in the categorization of a specific observation into a certain class. The interpretability of all the results and of all the steps of calculation is a clear advantage that maintenance experts can use in order to find answers to their questions. LAD detects and diagnoses complex phenomena such as equipment fault due to the interaction of multiple factors. Moreover, LAD is not based and does not need data on failure events. Thus, for physical assets that have a lifetime of 25 or 30 years, degradation can still be analyzed and maintenance decision can still be taken.
   During the learning process, LAD analyzes the collected data that represents readings of some physical asset's features such as vibration signals, oil analysis, temperature, etc..., which are taken while the asset is in different states, for example new, failing, deteriorating,, etc. It then generates patterns that can be easily interpreted and translated into meaningful physical rules. LAD automatically extracts features and generates patterns from the readings and, accordingly, classifies the asset into a certain state based on the patterns generated. The learning function of cbmLAD results in an accumulation and preservation of expert knowledge that can be used at any time by the user, even if the human expertise is lost due to retirement or resignation. It thus becomes a powerful knowledge management tool that automates and conserves knowledge.
   In the testing process LAD can detect and diagnose the asset's state based on the generated knowledge during the learning process. This process of learning and pattern generation serve to reinforce the theoretical knowledge and uncover new knowledge about a certain diagnostic problem in PAHM. LAD has been applied successful in different situations that will be presented in the following sections.

AB  - The learning environment has undergone a rapid change in the last decade. The traditional form of learning involving the pupil and teacher is fast becoming obsolete. Soon the idea of attending a college or even undergoing a structured format of learning may become a thing of the past. The advent of technology, the easy access to knowledge, the contribution from the field of psychology on the different dimensions of learning such as individual learning styles, the learning curve, the forgetting curve, the span of attention of a learner, the scope of competency development in various fields and in the 21st century skill sets requirements of a learner have brought about a paradigm shift in the education environs. Virtual tutors who allow a person to learn from multiple experts have replaced the teacher in the classroom. The mouse has taken over the chalk. Stakeholders in this domain, right from educators, employers, policy makers, parents and learners strongly believe and agree to the fact that technology has become an intrinsic part of today's learning.
   The key challenge in these changed circumstances is 'How can we innovate on Learning Value Creation' with technology and learning sciences?
   There are two major issues faced in the space of learning today. First issue faced by the learner is Information overload. With websites like Udemy [7] allowing uploading of various content / courses by Instructors / Tutors and the ability to construct a course in few hours, websites like khanacademy [5] offering thousands of video & audio based content on various subjects, the 21st century learner has a gamut of channels from where he/she is able to access knowledge. Today's adult learner needs to have the flexibility of asynchronous medium of learning to fit into his/her hectic schedule. He/she needs content that is engaging, relevant and specific to their field of interest.
   The second issue or challenge is customization. The rise in the emerging economies, the changing global demographics/redistribution of the global talent pool and the ubiquity of technology has opened a wider arena in the learning front. The global learner may be in any number, from any part of the world, with the same or different set of needs and aspirations and who is looking for an easy and effective medium of learning which meets their requirement. The bane here is personalization-how to cater to the diverse learning styles, learning needs and large groups. In this scenario, learning will have one objective-to enhance the effectiveness of the learning per se as well as cater to the needs of the learner so that the desired outcome is achieved. This requires a complete shift in the role of learning functions and their capability to design and deliver the content in the required manner. It will also reflect in the role an educator plays in the dissemination of knowledge. In short it is based on the ability of the learning function to create value for the learner. One of the key objectives of this endeavor will be to provide training interventions through platforms that add value through their offerings and show a demonstrable business value to the user.
   A key constituent to this entire scenario places the onus of learning on the content that is created or placed for the learners use. One such description of the first wave of learning experience has been by Carnegie Mellon who set out to design software for independent learners taking courses through the university's Open Learning Initiative [1], an effort to make courses freely available to non-enrolled learners. But rather than merely making course materials available to non-students, like MIT's famous Open Course ware project [2], Carnegie Mellon wanted to design courses that would respond to the individual needs of each student. The university is currently exploring how the open-learning software could be used in conjunction with classroom education to speed up the teaching and learning process. By combining the open-learning software with two weekly 50-minute class sessions in an intro-level statistics course, they found that they could get students to learn the same amount of material in half the time thereby vastly enhancing 'learning productivity'.
